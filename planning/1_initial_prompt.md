## Requirements Gathering
I want to build a webapp that will take in a csv export from goodreads, add additional genre metadata (google books api? something else?), and then display graphs on the browser. The idea is that a user will come to the site, upload their data, and it will be served on their browser. Maybe saved in cookies so it stays between sessions. No login. I don't want to be paying for a server to sit around and burn money all day, so ideally i want to host this in a cost effective, maybe serverless setup. I want to host it on aws. Preferably do the coding in python, unless there is some amazing/better javascrip/react. Particularly with regard to clean and professional graphs.

I want you to help me outline the requirements for this project. Act as a requirements gatherer and ask me code structure, infrastructure, and process questions that you would need to know before giving me technical recommendations

## Architecture Planning

## Project Overview
I want to build a webapp that will take in a csv export from goodreads, add additional genre metadata, and then display graphs on the browser.

## Plan the Infrastructure
I don't want to be paying for a server to sit around and burn money all day, so ideally i want to host this in a cost effective, maybe serverless setup. I want to host it on aws.

## Plan the Codebase
Preferably do the coding in python, unless there is some amazing/better javascrip/react. Particularly with regard to clean and professional graphs.

## Technical Questions
Will we get images and descripions from goodreads? google books api? where?




# Second Prompt
## Known Functionality
### Graphs
- num books by genre
- num books per year

### Lists
- list of books by genre
  - want to be able to see the cover image of the book and the brief description

if you get to the point where you click a book, it should go to that book on goodreads?
