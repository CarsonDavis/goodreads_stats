│ > ok, i think my local app is working pretty well, and im am ready to implement iac and cicd. take  │
│   a look at the infrastructure.md and the architecture.md and let me know if you have any           │
│   questions.  


  Implementation Status:
  1. What's currently implemented? I see you have the local system working - do you also have the
  local_server.py FastAPI server implemented?
fastapi should be implented. go ahead and check.
  2. Have you created any of the Lambda functions yet, or do we need to build everything from
  scratch?
there is zero aws implemented

  Infrastructure Choices:
  3. For IaC, do you prefer AWS SAM (simpler, serverless-focused) or CDK (more flexible)? SAM
  seems to align better with your architecture.
i've never heard of sam, only ckd. why would i want to use sam?
  4. For CI/CD, should we use GitHub Actions (since this appears to be a GitHub repo) or AWS
  CodePipeline?
github actions, definitely

  Domain & Deployment:
  5. Is codebycarson.com already set up in AWS with Route 53? Do you have CloudFront distributions
   configured?
i own codebycarson.com and it is in route 53. i don't think i have done anything else

  6. How do you want to handle the S3 bucket names? Should they include your domain (e.g.,
  codebycarson-goodreads-stats-data) or account ID for uniqueness?
there should be just one s3 bucket with many files in it. called goodreads-stats

  Monitoring & Config:
  7. Any preference for logging/monitoring? CloudWatch is included with Lambda, but do you want
  structured logging or error alerting?
lets do some basic logging 

  8. Should we set up different environments (dev/prod) or just prod for now?
multiple environments.
also, i've changed the urls i wanted and i've updated INFRASTRUCTURE.md and IAC.md
Production: goodreads-stats.codebycarson.com
Development: dev.goodreads-stats.codebycarson.com


so i realized that i needed to change the urls. opened a second window and ran this really quickly:

i need to change how we handle the urls in our application. the goal is to use:
Production: goodreads-stats.codebycarson.com
Development: goodreads-stats-dev.codebycarson.com
so the urls should change accordingly
research in my code base for everything that will need to change (the architecture.md should be helpful) and make the changes and update the documentation
