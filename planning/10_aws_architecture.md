ok, so before this we created the architecture.md based on the code. now we start a new chat...

ok, so we have our ARCHITECTURE.md, and a system that runs locally. however i now want to think about how we can have a system that runs both locally and on the cloud, and what the architecture will need to look like. read through the architecture and my code and ask me any clarifying questions you need to know, then we will work towards designing a system that will work on both local and prod, for uploading files, processing them, saving the json, loading them into the dashboad, etc

## Claude Questions
‚è∫ Based on your architecture and code, I can see you have a solid local system with:

  - Local processing: Python pipeline with async enrichment
  - Static frontend: Drag-and-drop CSV upload with dashboard
  - File-based storage: UUID-named JSON files in dashboard_data/
  - Environment detection: Already supports AWS Lambda execution

  Here are my clarifying questions to design the hybrid local/cloud system:

  1. User Experience & Access
  - Should the cloud version be available at the same URL as your local version, or separate?
local will be local host lol. stuff after the slashes will be the same. my website is codebycarson.com which will host many apps. this particualr app will live at codebycarson.com/goodreads-stats (which will take you to the upload page) 
  - Do you want user accounts/authentication, or anonymous processing like the current system?
  no user accounts, just anonymous processing, with the idea that a user will end up with a uuid to their personal dashboard with their data
  - Should users be able to access their dashboards from multiple devices?
  yes. anyone with the uuid will be able to access that json

  2. Cloud Processing Model
  - Do you prefer serverless (Lambda) or container-based (ECS/Fargate) processing?
  i want the cheapest easies option
  - Should the cloud version use the same Python pipeline or a different approach?
  lets keep the python pipeline
  - Any preference for real-time processing vs. background jobs with status polling?
what are the pros and cons? i know i want to keep the static website, which then maybe spawns a lambda orchestrator which in turn spawns all the api callers? but how does the lambda talk back to the static website? maybe i need some kind of fast api and gateway? i have no idea, you tell me.

  3. Data Storage & Persistence
  - For cloud: S3 for JSON files, or move to a database (DynamoDB/RDS)?
  for the json files, i want as cheap as possible, so s3
  - Should users be able to upload multiple CSV files and manage multiple dashboards?
  yes, this will be done by their uuids
  - Any data retention/cleanup requirements?
  yea, we can keep the jsons forever, but we let users delete them if they want

  4. API Design
  - RESTful API or GraphQL for cloud endpoints?
  rest
  - Should the same frontend work for both local and cloud, or separate interfaces?
  i just want to be able to do local development and deployment for people who don't want to use the webapp. so yes, the frontend code should be identical, with the only difference being in the env variables or something?

  5. Deployment & Infrastructure
  - Preferred cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)?
  aws
  - Budget constraints or cost optimization priorities?
  small budget
  - Any existing infrastructure to integrate with?
no infrastructer existing, just this codebase
  What's your vision for how users would choose between local vs cloud processing?
  local development versus website user


this eventually resulted in the INFRASTRUCTURE.md

ok. let's talk nitty gritty. how are we going to do deployment and secrets and stuff? like how will the static site know which 
  aws gateway, etc? i was thinking maybe cdk, github actions?

it says some stuff that sounds good, and now we have an ARCHITECTURE.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, and IAC.md
