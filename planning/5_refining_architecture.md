> ok, lets be clear about the architecture that I want...we need to have a clear separation of concerns. i want 
  to be able to pass in a single book natively, and handle csv processing and loading in a separate place, which 
  will then have a feeder into the genere supplementer. long term, the idea would be that we could make things 
  async and parallel, so that we can do muliple books at once and allow google and open to go at the same time

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze current architecture to understand needed refactoring                                
     ☐ Design new architecture with clear separation: CSV Loader -> Book Processor -> Genre Enricher
     ☐ Refactor BookDataOrchestrator to focus only on single book enrichment
     ☐ Create separate CSVProcessor/BookLoader for CSV handling
     ☐ Design async/parallel architecture for future scaling

⏺ Perfect. You want a cleaner architecture with these concerns:

  Key Components:

  1. GenreEnricher - Core class that takes a single BookInfo and returns single EnrichedBook
  2. CSVProcessor - Handles CSV loading, cleaning, sampling
  3. BookFeeder - Orchestrates feeding books from CSV into GenreEnricher (future: async/parallel)

  Interface:
  # Single book (primary interface)
  enricher = GenreEnricher()
  enriched_book = enricher.enrich_book(book_info)

  # CSV processing (separate concern)
  csv_processor = CSVProcessor()
  books = csv_processor.load_books("export.csv", sample_size=10)

  feeder = BookFeeder(enricher)
  enriched_books = feeder.process_books(books)  # Future: parallel/async

  This enables clean separation and easy async scaling. Should I refactor the current code to this architecture?
