no, i don't like that. lets instead always do both apis. for google books, lets always get the full response. for open, lets always get the work and the edition. then we can have a final merge.

actually, i'm thinking that lets create a more reliable architecture here. a core central functinoality that can hit apis and do retries, etc. then specialized processes for google and open. we can be building up a data model for a book in the meantime, and have processors to merge the genres in the end.

furthermore, the queries need to have fallbacks based on available data. we won't always have isbn, sometimes we will need to use title+author instead

write up a clear architecture plan to achieve these goals, incorporating current work where it makes sense

# Plan

Of course. Your thinking is spot onâ€”you're describing a classic data enrichment pipeline. This is a much more robust and scalable architecture that separates concerns, improves reliability, and gives you maximum control over the final data.

Here is a clear architectural plan to achieve these goals, incorporating and building upon the excellent work you've already done.

### **Architectural Plan: The Book Data Enrichment Pipeline**

The system will be composed of several distinct, specialized components that work together. Data will flow from fetching, through processing, to a final merged model.

**High-Level Data Flow:**

### **Component 1: The Central `Book` Data Model**

This will be our single source of truth for each book as it moves through the pipeline. It starts with input data and is progressively enriched by each step.

  * **Action:** Create a new `@dataclass` named `EnrichedBook`.
  * **Fields:**
      * `input_info: BookInfo` - The original data from your CSV.
      * `google_response: Optional[Dict] = None` - The raw, full JSON from Google Books.
      * `openlib_edition_response: Optional[Dict] = None` - Raw JSON from Open Library's Edition API.
      * `openlib_work_response: Optional[Dict] = None` - Raw JSON from Open Library's Work API.
      * `processed_google_genres: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)`
      * `processed_openlib_genres: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)`
      * `final_genres: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)` - The final, clean list.
      * `processing_log: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)` - A log of successes/failures for this specific book.

### **Component 2: The Resilient `APICaller` (Core Functionality)**

This new class will handle all outgoing HTTP requests, centralizing reliability logic.

  * **Action:** Create a new `APICaller` class.
  * **Responsibilities:**
    1.  **Rate Limiting:** It will instantiate and use the `RateLimiter` you already wrote.
    2.  **Retries with Exponential Backoff:** It will have a single `get()` method that wraps `requests.get()` in a `for` loop (e.g., 3 retries). On failure (timeout or 5xx server error), it will `time.sleep()` for an increasing duration (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s) before retrying.
    3.  **Unified Response:** The `get()` method will always return a standard tuple: `(success: bool, status_code: int, response_data: Optional[Dict])`. This abstracts away the success/failure logic from the modules that use it.

### **Component 3: The `DataFetcher` Modules**

These modules know *what* to ask for from each API, but not *how* to ask for it (they delegate that to the `APICaller`).

  * **Action:** Create a `fetchers` directory with two files: `google_fetcher.py` and `open_library_fetcher.py`.

  * **`google_fetcher.py`:**

      * Will contain a function `fetch_google_data(book: BookInfo, api_caller: APICaller) -> Optional[Dict]`.
      * **Query Strategy:**
        1.  If `book.isbn13` exists, construct query `q=isbn:{book.isbn13}`.
        2.  If that fails or no ISBN exists, construct fallback query `q=intitle:"{book.title}"+inauthor:"{book.author}"`.
        3.  Always include `projection=full` in the parameters.
      * It uses the provided `api_caller` to make the request and returns the raw JSON response.

  * **`open_library_fetcher.py`:**

      * Will contain a function `fetch_open_library_data(book: BookInfo, api_caller: APICaller) -> (Optional[Dict], Optional[Dict])`.
      * **Query Strategy:**
        1.  **Edition:** If an ISBN exists, call the Edition API (`/api/books?...`). From this response, extract the Work ID (e.g., `OL12345W`).
        2.  **Work:** If a Work ID was found, call the Work API (`/works/{work_id}.json`).
        3.  **Fallback:** If no ISBN exists, use the search API (`/search.json`) with title/author to find a Work ID, then proceed with the Work API call.
      * Returns two values: the raw edition JSON and the raw work JSON.

### **Component 4: The `DataProcessor` Modules**

These modules take the raw JSON from the fetchers and extract the specific data we need, primarily the genre lists.

  * **Action:** Create a `processors` directory with `google_processor.py` and `open_library_processor.py`.

  * **`google_processor.py`:**

      * Contains `process_google_response(raw_data: Dict) -> List[str]`.
      * This will reuse the excellent genre extraction logic you already wrote in `GoogleBooksClient._extract_genres`, which intelligently parses `mainCategory`, `categories`, and the description.

  * **`open_library_processor.py`:**

      * Contains `process_open_library_response(edition_data: Optional[Dict], work_data: Optional[Dict]) -> List[str]`.
      * This reuses the logic from `EnhancedOpenLibraryClient` to extract `subjects` from both the edition and work responses and combines them into a single, deduplicated list.

### **Component 5: The `GenreMerger` (Final Processing)**

This is the last step, where we standardize the combined data.

  * **Action:** Create a `genre_merger.py` module.
  * **Responsibilities:**
      * It will have a function `merge_and_normalize(google_genres: List[str], openlib_genres: List[str]) -> List[str]`.
    <!-- end list -->
    1.  **Combine & Deduplicate:** Merge the two lists into a single `set`.
    2.  **Normalization & Cleaning:**
          * Convert all genres to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase).
    <!-- end list -->
      * Returns the final, clean list of genres.

### **Component 6: The `Orchestrator`**

This is the main script (`open_library_analyzer.py` renamed to `book_data_pipeline.py`) that ties everything together.

  * **Action:** Refactor your `BookAPITester` into a new `Orchestrator` class.
  * **Workflow for each book:**
    1.  Initialize an `EnrichedBook` instance.
    2.  Use the `fetcher` modules to get the raw data, updating the `EnrichedBook` object.
    3.  Pass the raw data to the `processor` modules to get the extracted genre lists, updating the `EnrichedBook` object.
    4.  Pass the processed genre lists to the `GenreMerger` to get the final list.
    5.  Store the fully `EnrichedBook` object.
  * The `Orchestrator` will still contain all your excellent reporting methods (`display_coverage_report`, etc.), now adapted to pull data from the `EnrichedBook` model.

This architecture provides a clear, maintainable, and highly reliable system for achieving your goal. It separates responsibilities cleanly, making it easy to modify or improve any single part (like the genre normalization rules) without affecting the others.
