This sounds like a really interesting project! I'd love to help you think through the requirements systematically. Let me ask some key questions to understand your needs better:

## Data & Processing Requirements

**Goodreads Data:**
- Have you looked at what's actually in a Goodreads CSV export? What fields are included and how many books are we typically talking about per user?
No. I may need you to write a script that can read the export to understand it's format and available fields. Especially things such as which headers exist, which fields always have a value, etc. I know my goodreads has over 600 read books, which is the primary category.
- Do you want to process all books or focus on specific subsets (read books, rated books, etc.)?
read books only

**Genre Metadata:**
- What specific genre information are you looking to add beyond what Goodreads provides?
i don't think that the export has genre as in history, fantasy, etc
- How should the app handle books that can't be found in the external API, or books with conflicting genre information?
goodreads doesn't have an api available to the public. it has been made private.
- Are you open to using multiple APIs (Google Books + maybe OpenLibrary, Goodreads API) for better coverage?
we will probably have to do this, in case one api is missing something. Also we may not always have an isbn, so we may need to build a fallback mechanism

**Data Processing:**
- Would you prefer the genre enrichment to happen client-side in the browser, server-side, or a hybrid approach?
i don't know. talk to me about pros and cons
- How important is processing speed vs accuracy of genre matching?
there will be more than one genre per book, for sure. talk to me about the ramifications of your question

## User Experience & Visualization

**Graphs & Analytics:**
- What specific types of visualizations are you envisioning? (reading trends over time, genre breakdowns, rating distributions, page count analysis, etc.)
I want to keep it simple at first, to keep the project small. genre breakdowns, rating distributions, page counts, all sound interesting, but lets keep it to maybe 6 or fewer key graphs to start
- Any preference for chart libraries? (D3.js, Chart.js, Plotly, etc.)
I know nothing about this, need to have guidance.
- Should users be able to filter/interact with the graphs?
undecided. depending on the graph it might be a really nice feature

**User Flow:**
- Should the processing happen immediately after upload, or would you want a "processing..." state for large datasets?
depends on how long processing takes
- How should errors be handled (API rate limits, malformed CSVs, etc.)?
pop up box to the user that explains the error

## Technical Architecture & Infrastructure

**Processing Location:**
- Are you leaning toward doing the API calls and data processing on AWS Lambda functions, or would client-side processing in the browser work for your use case?
i don't understand the pros and cons
- How do you feel about API rate limiting - would batching requests or caching common book data be worth the complexity?
caching sounds interesting, but maybe as a feature that we leave room for but don't implement until version 2

**Data Persistence:**
- Beyond cookies, would you consider localStorage, or do you want to avoid any server-side storage entirely?
I don't know what local storage is
- How long should the data persist, and what happens when storage limits are hit?
What storage limits?

**AWS Services:**
- Any preferences or constraints on specific AWS services? (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, etc.)
no constraints
- What's your comfort level with AWS configuration and deployment?
very familiar. would like to do iac via opentofu 

## Constraints & Preferences

**Budget & Scale:**
- What's your target budget range, and how many users are you expecting?
fewer than 1000 users per month
- Would you prefer to optimize for absolute minimum cost or for development simplicity?
application performance and minimum cost are more important than simplicity

**Technical Stack:**
- You mentioned Python preference - are you thinking Flask/FastAPI for any backend components, or full frontend focus?
I simply am not as familiar with javascript. if a perfect python solution exists, i would rather use that. however, it is extremely important that the interface look elegant and modern and streamlined -- it can't be ugly or outdated
- For graphs, are you aware that libraries like Plotly have excellent Python integration but also great JavaScript options?
i'm unfamiliar

Which of these areas would you like to dive into first?
