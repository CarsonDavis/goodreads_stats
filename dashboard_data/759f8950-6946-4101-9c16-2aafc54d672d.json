      "my_review": "This is my third book on China after WWII, and by far the one that I recommend. I also read Mao's Great Famine, and although it gave an excellent picture of the famine, it lacked the human understanding that could communicate _how_ it happened. Like, why the citizenry put up with it. <br/><br/>Especially in the early part about the warlord era, Wild Swans can lag at times. About 3 hours in I wrote that, \"it really begins to just feel like a recitation of facts.\" But I think the early part about the grandmother was quite interesting -- hearing about her foot binding and the way women were treated. The suicide of her grandfather's son to protest the marriage. The insane lives of concubines. <br/><br/>Historically, it is very clear to me why the american-backed forces lost. The reign of torture and terror. The insistence on the protection of the upper class. The backing of traditional anti-woman stances.<br/><br/>I've written already about Wild Swans in my review of Mao's Great Famine, so I'll skip some of that here. It's horrifying to me how much destruction was done by the Red Guards, of historic monuments, books, and culture. I shudder to think of what was lost. The terrifying group mentality of young people seems something to be reckoned with, at an age where peer pressure is its strongest. I'd be interested to see an age breakdown of historic global atrocities. How many of them were committed on the ground in large part by people under 25, whose prefrontal cortexes hadn't finished developing?<br/> <br/>It's insane to think about students beating their teachers every day, and living in a world where as a teacher you can't leave - there is no option but to endure. <br/><br/>It's incredible the way Mao turned on his closest allies and the whole country just let it happen. <br/><br/>There is so much to ponder here about the human condition, and I feel that I should at least revisit a summary of this book every couple years. <br/>",

      "my_review": "I'd like to first explain the 3 star rating. I tend to reserve 4 stars for books that I would happily recommend to many people. For non-fiction, that tends to require that they be somewhat easily readable. Despite the great subject matter, this book is certainly not readable -- it is rather a slog to get through. If we were talking about importance of the content, this is an easy 5 star read. But I think that there surely must be easier ways to consume the information. Namely, I have now also read Wild Swans - a tri-biographical picture of three generations of women who grew up first in the warlord period, then the communist revolution, then the cultural revolution - and it gives a much broader perspective that really provides the reader with the ability to understand _how_ the tragedy of the great famine occurred.<br/><br/>It's important to me to get to grips with the time period and understand it, but it's been hard for me to really summarize my thoughts on the book, because there was so, SO much to learn and digest. It's an overwhelming amount of information and connections. So let me sort of just word vomit some of the connections I learned, both from this book, and from Three Swans.<br/><br/>After the war with Japan, you had two sides in China. The Communists and the American backed forces. The American backed forces tended to be associated with the land owners and the elite. They were well-funded and often considered corrupt, and they were well known to brutally torture and kill communists and suspected communists. When the communists eventually gained power, it was by being in sync with the wants of the peasants, and deliberately denouncing the power and privilege of the monied and landed elite. Prior to the communist take over, officials across China were just assumed to be corrupt and to engage in constant nepotism to benefit their families. It wasn't even necessarily looked down upon - any man who was raised to power would be absolutely expected to bring his family and extended family along with him.<br/><br/>Women in the old world occupied an extremely lowly position. As children and teens, they were expected to obey their parents in all things. And then, after a husband was chosen for them, they were expected to obey him as well. As an American reader, it is tempting to think that I can relate, having heard about such attitudes in our own 40s and 50s. But this is a mistake. As far as I can see, there is no comparison.  A popular saying said something to the effect of, \"If you marry a chicken, obey the chicken. If you marry a dog, obey the dog.\" A bride has no choice but to accept the life and commands of her husband.<br/><br/>In Wild Swans, the eldest woman was of the warlord era, and she had her feet broken as a child so they could be bound. She was married as an official concubine to a local official so that her family could get ahead in life. Seriously - women held such a place in life that concubines were a wide-spread, officially sanctioned, and culturally accepted practice. <br/><br/>So, as we consider the great famine, and how it was allowed to happen at all levels, we have to understand that the communist party line was considered absolute. It was meant to overthrow centuries of social practices which allowed such corruption and nepotism. It also meant to eliminate discrimination against women, peasants, and the lower classes. Criticizing communist ideas was deeply discouraged, and blind loyalty to the party was the ideal. In the beginning, perhaps this made sense, as many of the ideals enforced equality, prevented wasteful excess on funerals and weddings, and generally seemed to move China from an age of backwardness into a time of progress. <br/><br/>But the party line also featured a slavish devotion to an impossible, and often imagined, ideal. Peasants, and their supposedly intense struggle and hard-working ethos, were held up as a golden example for every citizen to follow. And so you end up with pregnant women being told to march with bad nutrition and illness until they miscarried, because, after all, don't peasants give birth in the fields and just keep on working? You see major illnesses brushed off as anti-communist attempts to shirk work, because obviously a real communist would be dedicated to the cause. <br/><br/>If you were a member of the party, it slowly took over all aspects of your life. For a time, members were only allowed to see their spouses on Saturdays. Both husbands and wives were expected to sleep in the very offices where they worked. If you wanted to marry in the old days, it was your family that arranged it and allowed it. In this new world, if you wanted to marry, you submitted an application to the party. <br/><br/>There was a cult-like practice of self criticism, where you would sorrowfully admit everything you did that was against the party to your peers. If you didn't do a good enough job, you might be forced to continue to criticize yourself day after day for months. This practice happened at all levels of society and the party, from the peasants all the way up to top party leaders. Bosses and co-workers would memorize tiny infractions in action or ideology and trot them out during criticisms to degrade and humiliate their enemies. <br/><br/>In a society where individualism was being actively demolished - on a political, personal and social level - the acceptance of the community was essential to an individual's well-being. So at all levels, people were constantly forced into conformity, and punished for stepping outside of it.<br/><br/>As a result, anti-intellectualism flourished, and groups which had reservations about communist party ideology were intensely criticized, removed from political power, and socially ostracized. <br/><br/>Much of my understanding of these social aspects came not from Dikotter's work, but from Wild Swans. As I read through Mao's Great Famine, I couldn't help but be constantly horrified and shocked at how regular people were entirely complicit in the widespread cruelty and suffering throughout China. <br/><br/>In 1958, my understanding is that Mao wasn't really a dictator in the way I personally imagine them, as backed by the might of a state military. He was simply the leader of his party, and could theoretically have been usurped. However, he held absolutely massive political sway backed by an incredible cult of personality. Despite many party actions being theoretically done by committee, criticizing or disagreeing with Mao was political and social suicide, and so functionally speaking, he was a practical dictator. <br/><br/>Indeed, I think most textbooks would classify him as such, but I think it is essential to recognize the difference between a military dictator, who rules by force of arms, and a social dictator, who strangles the hearts and minds of the people in an icy grip.<br/><br/>In fact, there are several instances where it looks like his power might wane, but he carefully divides and denounces the possible opposition. I think this is especially interesting to consider in the light of modern populist leaders. <br/><br/>But, let me talk just briefly about the famine itself and the domino effect of how it happened. <br/>- can't cook at home anymore, fed by canteens<br/>- desire to fertilize so tear down houses <br/>- need steel, so stop farming to do steel production<br/>- need steel, so melt all the tools and cookware<br/>- need steel, so deforest<br/>- numbers are inflated at every step of the chain, so party planners are deluded<br/>- mao tells farms they produced too much, eat and get fat<br/>- they kill birds that eat bad insects<br/>- need massive irrigation, but don't trust intellectuals. bad dams and irrigation built<br/>  - this wastes time and ruins previously working fields<br/>  - later these dams collapse, killing people or ruining fields<br/>- runoff from the deforested land ruins agricultural land<br/>- deep plowing prevents water retention<br/>- mao wants to be the leader of the 3rd world, so he gives away food to countries that ask for it, in the middle of famine<br/>- russia offers to delay loans, but mao wants to look strong, so he pays back loans with food at an accelerated rate<br/>- international communities offer aid, but it is considered an insult and is denied<br/>- local people blame their immediate overloads, not mao<br/><br/>There's a lot more to write here, but I need to close this out so I can look at some other books. I found suicide to be a particularly particularly interesting phenomena. In Wild Swans, they talk about how in the warlord era a woman is expected to marry who her parents choose. If she says she doesn't want to marry, she is being virtuous and chaste. If she says she wants to keep living with her parents she is being virtuous and filial. Only if she commits suicide are her protests taken seriously.<br/><br/>Suicide also seemed to be the only public protest in a world where society comes always before the individual. I gathered a couple quotes from the book related to suicide and group killings.  <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In Luoding county, Guangdong, local cadre Qu Bendi beat to death an eight-year-old who had stolen a handful of rice. In Hunan, Tan Yunqing, aged twelve, was drowned in a pond like a puppy for having pilfered food from the canteen.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Sometimes parents were forced to inflict the punishment. When a boy stole a handful of grain in the same village in Hunan where Tan Yunqing was drowned, local boss Xiong Changming forced his father to bury him alive. The father died of grief a few days later.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Dikotter highlights one crushing scene where a woman tries to get permission from her work leader to take her sick child to the hospital. Permission is denied, but desperate, she goes anyway. She leaves her two other children behind, to be looked after by the village. She makes it to the hospital, only for her son to die. Distraught, she returns to the village, only to find that her neighbors have ignored her children, now sick and crawling with worms. They both die. The local cadre comes to her house every day to accuse her of shirking. She ultimately loses her mind. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Some of the abused women felt too ashamed to return to their homes. Twenty-four-year-old Zhu Renjiao, stripped and paraded for petty theft, ‘felt too ashamed to face people’ and asked to be moved to another village. She killed herself when her request was turned down.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In Kaiping county, a fifty-six-year-old lady pilfered two handfuls of grain. Her entire household was banned from the canteen for five days and sent to a labour camp. She committed suicide.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In another small village in Guangdong, the militia stripped two young women and tied them to a tree, using a flashlight to explore one of the girl’s private parts, and drawing a large turtle – symbol of the male organ – on the other woman’s body. Both committed suicide.<br/></blockquote>",

      "my_review": "3.5? This was another good installment from Bennett. It was a good, easy read, and it was fun to see more of this world. I don't know that it quite gets 4 stars from me. Worth reading if you liked the first one, but this is not a resounding recommendation from me. <br/><br/>The characters and peoples are interesting. The sexual elements made me pause a bit. I suppose they are pretty realistic, and they did give some opportunities for humor, but I guess they just didn't really add much to the story for me? <br/><br/>It's been a while since I read the first one, but I want to say that I liked it better. I remember feeling engaged by the story and enraptured by the wildly different world. This book just felt clumsier.",

      "my_review": "Another excellent work by Ted Chiang. Overall, this was not as good as Stories of Your Life...3.5 rounded up to 4? I'd say if you liked the first one, you'll like this, but it definitely isn't as good. He really held the reader's hand throughout the stories, force-feeding you the philosophy, the setting, and the plot. Everything was too clearly spelled out, and it gave the stories an almost young adult feeling as a result. It's like the author didn't trust his audience to take the right message from each story, so he was super careful to explain all the plot and science details and then tell us the right way to feel at the end. Now, the creativity and the situations were still fantastic, and this is still overall a book worth reading, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed coming off his previous masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate<br/>A fun, consistent story about time travel. Doesn't really uncover any new ground<br/><br/>Exhalation<br/>Suffers from over-explanation. Fun idea though, and great way to hit home what may happen to our own universe.<br/><br/>The Lifecycle of Software Objects<br/>Also very interesting, particularly now, in the wake of the LLM revolution. It's a nice exploration, but it failed to engage me, and, as usual, it over explained its own point. It's like the author didn't trust us to see all the implications, so he made sure to have the characters carefully walk us through them.<br/><br/>Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny<br/>fun. I think I may have liked this one more than the others<br/><br/>The Great Silence<br/>eh<br/><br/>Omphalos<br/>Again, a really fun idea. Having suffered through my share of creation science, I enjoyed this one more than some others. But I still feel that it was very, very on the nose. I wouldn't mind letting some of my less scientifically-minded friends read this though.<br/><br/>Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom<br/>Good ending on this one. Chiang's endings rarely disappoint. Another that felt too explained, but I did definitely enjoy it.",

      "my_review": "Overall, this was excellent. Much darker than the Ted Chiang stories, and often longer, but with more emotional impact. Although some of them ponder technological progress and alien civilizations, just as many are concerned with painful episodes of the Chinese experience. Overall this was an excellent collection that I would highly recommend.<br/><br/>The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species<br/>Interesting but forgettable. <br/><br/>State Change<br/>Souls tied to objects. Quite an interesting idea. A little bit of forced messaging. I feel like I'm hyper sensitive these days whenever I see men writing the supposed sex lives of female characters. Her choice of how to finally exhaust her soul felt somehow demeaning in an abstract way, but maybe I'm being too harsh.<br/><br/>The Perfect Match<br/>All seeing personal assistants. Another good one. Follows a kind of expected path -- I don't think that Liu manages the sort of really technologically innovative story that Chiang sometimes does -- but I still enjoyed the ride. <br/><br/>Good Hunting<br/>Fox demon girl and lost magic. We are getting into darker territory here with this one, as the railroads kill the magic of the land. This one was told in spurts, and was one of the nicer stories in the bunch. A great use of the short format.<br/><br/>The Literomancer 4.5/5 maybe 5/5<br/>Girl with CIA father. I guess I just like dark stories, and this is darker than most. A little graphic at times, but chilling. Throughout some of the later stories, Liu really explores the dehumanizing effect of politics and the state. Stories like this one are a great compressed history lesson in human atrocities, paranoia, and misplaced intentions.<br/><br/>Simulacrum<br/>Father with holo daughter. Brutally judgmental children seem to be a recurring theme in this collection. Some interesting ponderings here on what it means to be you, and what it means to change.<br/><br/>The Regular<br/>Cyborg lady detective. Simply an enjoyable story with a satisfying ending. <br/><br/>The Paper Menagerie<br/>Excellent. I cried. Heartbreaking and sadly believable. I enjoy all the themes that Liu touches on. Here, it is the isolation and loneliness of immigration. <br/><br/>An Advanced Reader’s Picture Book<br/>Mom who wants to be fermi. Great intertwining here, with the perfect sad ending.<br/><br/>The Waves<br/>Immortal space travelers. This felt like multiple good stories in one. Sometimes I feel like Liu doesn't know when to end his stories, but then as he keeps going, I keep enjoying them. <br/><br/>Mono no aware<br/>Lone japanese survivor suicide. Not too much here that makes it stand out from similar stories, but it was still well done with some good emotion at the end. <br/><br/>All the Flavors<br/>Chinese gold miner cook. A reluctant feel-good weaving of myth and history, this one gives us a story to latch onto while talking about the first wave of Chinese immigrants. I can't help but admire the easy way that Liu weaves in darkness of the past with out ever raising the hackles of the reader. <br/><br/>A Brief History of the Trans‑Pacific Tunnel<br/>Tunnel. This is a fun alternate history. Seems like an improvement over our history, until you discover that humanity sucks in ever timeline. Painfully realistic.<br/><br/>The Litigation Master and the Monkey King<br/>Monkey king lawyer. The whole second half of the book is a roller coaster ride through the dark parts of the chinese historical experience. This reminds me of the 1381 Peasants Revolt in England. The way the written word is a tool that the ruling class weaponizes to subjugate and marginalize the lower. It's such an alien view to my modern sensibilities, but I see it again and again in history. The German Peasants war of the 1520s also had elements of peasants revolting against written contracts. Anyway, this was another dark, and good story.<br/><br/>The Man Who Ended History<br/>Time travel atrocities. Another exploration of the darker side of real history, couched in the fantastical setting of time travel that erases the past. The time travel mechanic is really interesting, I've never heard anything similar proposed. Some really interesting (although overly spelled out) comparisons to archeology. I may be in the minority with this complaint, as perhaps this is not an association that would occur to the average reader. This one is less powerful as a story, and feels more like rough expose meshed with an interesting idea. One the most impactful books I read in 2024 was The Rape of Nanking, so I may be a little biased in my high reviews for adjacent subjects.",

      "my_review": "The whole collection is just masterful. The stories are engaging and well-written, and as soon as you begin to ponder on them you are struck by the insight, creativity, and intelligence of their author. It is not without reason that some of these stories have been turned into movies. <br/><br/>In the comments at the end, the author says, \"One of the things we admire most in fiction is an ending that is surprising but inevitable.\" This is fully evidenced in his writing. The endings are uniformly wonderful.<br/><br/>Todd McLaren, great narrator.<br/><br/>Tower of Babylon - 3.5/5<br/>Interesting and well written, with a nice math thing going on there, but not quite as much punch as I had hoped for. <br/><br/>Understand - 4.5/5<br/>I find most literary portrayals of genius to be frankly uninspired. Uncreative, uninteresting, unrealistic, and seemingly conceived by authors who barely manage to be above average themselves. Understand was captivating, thrilling, and let shine the author's own formidable intelligence. The mechanics of the ending were wonderful, but I question the need for any battle at all. It must simply be the case that they could have achieved their aims in concert without death.<br/><br/>Division by Zero - 4/5<br/>Lovely idea. Not the most engaging. Interesting ideas of empathy, sympathy, and understanding. Great ending.<br/><br/>Stories of Your Life - 4.5/5<br/>Great intertwining, great plot, great emotion. The author touches on so much. Linearity of time, linguistics, determinism. As usual, the author has punchy endings.<br/><br/>72 Letters - 3.5/5<br/>Pretty good. I don't know that Chiang does action as well as contemplation. The idea is really neat -- a world where homunculi and golems are real and normal. I love that Chiang never babies you into a story, he immerses you in the world and lets you swim. The ending is a really interesting view of the philosophical implications of DNA. <br/><br/>The Evolution of Human Science - 3/5<br/>Can't even remember the ending.<br/><br/>Hell is the Absence of God - 5/5<br/>DAYUM. What a great story. I have the feeling it could be read by a devout or an atheist with similar pleasure. I love how it speaks of the arbitrariness of God's acts, the senseless casualties of miracles, the internal struggle with blessing and curse. The idea that god is truly real, but people struggle to love him and go to hell anyway. Really the whole thing is masterfully crafted. And the ending. I was so worried it would be trite and disappointing. It was perfect. <br/><br/>Liking what You See - 4/5<br/>Are we more fully realized when we minimize the physical part of our natures? This is simply great. All the different viewpoints. The comparisons to magic. The incredible foresight of filters etc.",

      "my_review": "initial thoughts: <br/>summer of fire and blood wasn't bad, but I think it lacked a general reader's overview. it was a touch scholarly and lacked a bit of assumed context which I definitely did not have<br/> <br/>could have greatly benefited from a broader perspective on how the revolt played out - I felt like it took the major battles as a given, and they were brushed aside so quickly that I often didn't even realize they happened. same with many of the massacres<br/><br/>I think this was a book that was more concerned with reevaluating the place of certain men in the movement at large, in understanding peasant and town motivations and, notably, understanding the place of women<br/><br/>some of the analysis was very good. I greatly enjoyed learning about how the peasants endured serfdom in germany, and I feel this backdrop is extremely important to understanding the reformation in general. stuff like how they couldn't travel at night without permission from their lords. if they married a freewoman, she and her children would become subject to the lord. it was like slavery-lite. the lord demanded taxes and labor, at the expense of the peasants' own fields. <br/><br/>and on top of that, you could owe towards multiple lords, and be sold and traded between lords. you could owe an entire hen every year to the local monastery, which would then compete with your egg sales in nearby towns. <br/><br/>i had no idea how economically dominant the nunneries and monasteries were. special ponds full of fish that the peasants had to buy during lent. luxurious beds and buildings.<br/><br/>a massive part of the early revolt was just in burning castles and monasteries, and not in killing anyone. <br/><br/>I do think the author had a little bit of an imposed modern view of sexuality, often strangely characterizing the male rebels' emphasis on \"brotherhood\" as somehow exclusionary towards women in an intentional way. along with some unsubstantiated comments about how the common man was a brother, but the common woman was a whore. I was extremely interested to hear what part women played in the revolution, how they were able to keep the farms going, how they were absolved of guilt after the fact, who they ran out of town, what part they may have played in formulating demands, etc. but I often felt the author took an unhistorically negative view of the men as intentionally disregarding the women's desires that wasn't supported by the evidence aside from conjecture.<br/><br/>Interestingly, there was very little anti-jewish sentiment by the rebels, despite their positions as lenders. There were instances of taking back possessions, but no pogroms, as we often see. Similarly, there is very little evidence of rape by the peasant armies, while conversely, there is much talk of rape by the retaliatory forces. <br/><br/>i need to come back here and add a more considered review, especially in the context of broader themes. these are just some off the top of my head reflections.",

      "my_review": "easy 3.5 rounded down. Honestly, I should maybe give it a 4. This is a very readable account of the middle ages that covers a lot of territory, but does it in a satisfying, interesting way.<br/><br/>One of my biggest takeaways is the breathtaking disregard for human life. Again and again, in every age, in every country, people just brutal tortured and massacred each other. <br/><br/>Dirty muslim? Massacre. Wrong kind of christian? Massacre. Protested the government? Massacre. Minding your own business on some valuable land? Massacre. Wealthy merchant? Massacre.<br/><br/>Some of the stand outs for me was the realization that they started calling crusades on *other christians*. Like holy shit. For example, there was the Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) in southern France, where they massacred entire villages whether they were Cathar or not. The papal legate was famously quoted as saying, \"Kill them all; God will know His own.\" Modern historians think a minimum of 200,000 people were killed, for a mix of political, linguistic, and cultural reasons, and importantly, for being the wrong kind of Christian.<br/><br/>Good reads is a garbage website, and doesn't let you have a end date unless the text is posted, so until I can come back and add some more thoughts, I'll jot a few notes here which I will later flesh out:<br/>- prayer and donations to the church as a hobby for the rich, vs intellectualism and research in the 1700s-1800s<br/>- how delayed was the industrial revolution because of religious attitudes?<br/>- anti-intellectualism in the church<br/>- the latin west killing a latin ruler of jerusulem?<br/>- the insane insistence of all people in all times for obsessing over self-denial. ancient ascetism mirroring modern veganism/5am workouts/etc<br/>- didn't talk as much as I wanted about the transition from serfdom to a middle class of merchants, etc. would really like to read a dedicated treatment<br/>- need to revisit the protestant reformation and it's larger political and economic effects<br/><br/>",

As usual, Matt Dinniman provides an engaging read, and the narrator Jeff Hayes is incredible. <br/><br/>It may be that I needed more of a refresher on the characters after almost a year between reading books 6 and 7, but some of the scenes which I think should have had a lot of punch for me just didn't. Like, when they killed the empress, I couldn't even remember who she was. <br/><br/>The former crawlers were a bit of a let down for me. I think we had a real opportunity for some really amazing showcasing of the incredible mastery that a former crawler should have over the dungeon environment. They beat the dungeon, and then lived in it season after season. I was expecting them to explode onto the stage with jaw dropping mastery, but they just kinda seemed like normal characters to me. <br/><br/>As always, I love as the AI gets increasingly powerful and unhinged. <br/><br/>It's been said before, but I have to wonder what it would be like if Matt had edited versions that came out after the serialization.<br/><br/>If you liked the other 6 books then you'll like this one, and I certainly will continue to read whatever Matt writes in this series.",

I have no idea why authors go out of their way to ruin the endings of their own books like this. <br/><br/>[spoilers ahead]<br/><br/>Overall the case was totally fascinating. I found myself rooting for the imposter the entire time, and was crushed at the ending. Socially, there was a lot to find interesting in the book. <br/><br/>For instance, the seeming prevalence of lawsuits between peasants. The book makes it seems like a somewhat common occurrence, and this is really not at all how I imagine village life. It's also always shocking to see the casual disregard for human life. The absolutely trivial things for which you could be tortured or get the death penalty are wild. <br/><br/>This book is short and interesting enough to make it an easy recommendation.",

      "my_review": "Excellent reading as always from Le Guin. Compared to The Dispossesed, I found the characters and plot in this book much more integral and compelling. <br/><br/>It's interesting as she explore gender as something which both limits and enables us. Her fascinating idea of human's perpetual baseline sexual arousal as perverted and socially limiting. The idea of gender as being such a key philosophical duality that without it, a society might not focus on dualities at all. Her exploration of how gender might drive us towards competition and success. <br/><br/>I should note that George Guidall is a miserable narrator -- incredibly awkward pacing at a sentence level, full of weird pauses, rushed phrases and nonsensical intonations. I switched to Michael Crouch and it was much better.<br/><br/>This is a short and interesting enough book that I think it is worth the read. If it lacked the interesting philosophizing, I don't think that it would stand on it's own though. 3.5 rounded up to represent the recommendation.<br/><br/>I've left a few quotes from the book here that I made note of while I read.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next. <br/></blockquote><br/>Love this. It's like why playing games with cheat codes eventually gets boring, or why eventually dying can be said to give life scope and meaning.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The First Mobile, if one is sent, must be warned that unless he is very self-assured, or senile, his pride will suffer. A man wants his virility regarded, a woman wants her femininity appreciated, however indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation. On Winter they will not exist. One is respected and judged only as a human being. It is an appalling experience.<br/></blockquote><br/>Le Guin is always grounding us throughout the book with these little reminders of how ingrained gender is in our culture.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Being so strictly denned and limited by nature, the sexual urge of Gethenians is really not much interfered with by society: there is less coding, channeling, and repressing of sex there than in any bisexual society I know of. Abstinence is entirely voluntary; indulgence is entirely acceptable. Sexual fear and sexual frustration are both extremely rare. This was the first case I had seen of the social purpose running counter to the sexual drive. Being a suppression, not merely a repression, it produced not frustration, but something more ominous, perhaps, in the long run: passivity.<br/></blockquote><br/>Le Guin is exploring her how our very sexuality might give us passion and drive. The competition, the preening, the desire to be desired...what happens when that's gone? She may not be far off basis here. I've heard some decent theorizing that some of the driving of evolution intelligence might have come from sexual selection, especially regarding cross-cutting intelligence like humor and eloquence.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>he chuckled a little and said, \"In kemmer all the time… Is it a place of reward, then? Or<br/>a place of punishment?\"<br/></blockquote><br/>Again on the same theme. Even human society has been smattered with groups that voluntarily deny sexuality, like monks and nuns.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>\"Tell me, how does the other sex of your race differ from yours?...Are they like a different species?\"<br/>\"No. Yes. No, of course not, not really. But the difference is very important. I suppose the most important thing, the heaviest single factor in one's life, is whether one's born male or female. In most societies it determines one's expectations, activities, outlook, ethics, manners—almost everything. Vocabulary. Semiotic usages. Clothing. Even food. Women…women tend to eat less… It's extremely hard to separate the innate differences from the learned ones. Even where women participate equally with men in the society, they still after all do all the childbearing, and so most of the child-rearing…\"<br/>\"Equality is not the general rule, then? Are they mentally inferior?\"<br/>\"I don't know. They don't often seem to turn up mathematicians, or composers of music, or inventors, or abstract thinkers. But it isn't that they're stupid. Physically they're less muscular, but a little more durable than men. Psychologically—\" After he had stared a long time at the glowing stove, he shook his head. \"Harth,\" he said, \"I can't tell you what women are like...In a sense, women are more alien to me than you are.\"<br/></blockquote><br/>It can be hard to separate what the character in a book thinks from what the author thinks. Is this Le Guin's opinion? Or it this what the thinks a man would think? Either way, it says something very interesting about the state of gender equality in 1969.",

      "my_review": "I quite liked this. He does a great job of capturing the insanely large numbers involved. With the book being so short, it is nice afterwards to just spend some time in the thought experiments. <br/><br/>One big oversight in the whole thing is teamwork. They really ought to have assembled larger and larger groups that could systematically increase the speed of searching, everyone searching the same area, but with a linear increase in speed, and then keeping meaningful books and trading them among themselves. With the eons of time proposed, this should really have been among the possibilities covered. But then, how could you trust your group? Once evil person could carefully throw away a good books and tell no one, leaving you to need to search the entire library twice.<br/><br/>It's fascinating to think of such a limited infinity. You have here the theoretical dream of infinite life, with a functionally infinite possibility of books and human experience. And yet somehow the constraints on infinity are so brutal as so seem unconscionable. Would I wish for this eternity in lieu of death? <br/><br/>Anyway, this is so short and novel that it is hard not to recommend. It's not the best writing in the world, but it's plenty good enough to enjoy for a couple hours.",

      "my_review": "This is probably the most traditional of the three books, with straightforward plot and consistent characters. It tries to deal with the notion of the plan being upended and the ramifications of the first foundation focusing on the revelation of the second. <br/><br/>I should leave a note here about the gendered attitudes. They are certainly off-putting at first glance, consistently showing women as browbeaten, ditzy, or deemed unimportant by their male counterparts. However, their actual actions in the story often show them as central or capable figures, like the ditzy mistress who is revealed to be a calculating agent. I probably spend too much time thinking about sexism in books, but this almost feels like an author living in a sexist world trying to write convention bucking female characters and only partially succeeding. It will be interesting to hop on the internet and read what people have to say on the matter.<br/><br/>The twists and turns are interesting and the plot is fun. Sadly, the tension just isn't there. I never really felt any deep involvement in the characters, and never felt any uncertainty about whether it would all work out, which kept the climaxes from having any real excitement or impact. <br/><br/>Ultimately this gets a 3.5 or so from me. This is one of those old books that I'm not sure I can see what all the fuss is about in retrospect. Perhaps it was groundbreaking for it's time, or has been influential for generations, but taken out of it's context and read as if it were any other book on my list, it fails to shine. It was average and enjoyable enough, but it isn't something that I will be recommending anyone to read.",

      "my_review": "A more character-focused version of the first book, that keeps mostly to a single crisis. By focusing more on the single element, it abandons the grace given to it in the previous work, which stretched over many decades. Book one brushed off action and characters as mostly inconsequential, and I accepted this as part of the style. However, here we are expected to follow along with the husband, and wife, and fool, and they disappoint. Their characters lack interest and their plot lacks pizzaz. Maybe it would sound good in outline form, but the actual implementation simply isn't exciting or engaging. <br/><br/>The conceit in this book, of a telepathic manipulator, is even more unbelievable than the conceit of the first, and it leaves me only grudgingly holding back my disbelief. And the surprise twist was obvious from almost as soon as they met the fool. <br/><br/>There's a weird consciousness of 1950s gender roles, that leaves me wondering if Asimov was a progressive leaving intentional commentary on the times, was virtue signaling, was mildly sexist himself, or what. It's almost like he was asked why there were no female characters in the first book, and decided that he really ought to include one in his second, but simply didn't know how. He simultaneously relegates her to the role of a cooking housewife, but then has her noticed by other planets as an \"equal\", and then ends by making her the only effective character in the entire novel, save for the mule himself. <br/><br/>Anyway, this isn't actively bad in a way that would give it 2 stars, but it certainly wasn't particularly worthwhile. 3 stars and absolutely no higher.",

      "my_review": "That was fun. I've stayed away from Asimov for some years, because I had heard that he was a poor character writer, that his characters were paper figures dancing on the long roll of history. And to some extent, this is true. But I don't know that this can ever be a critique of the writing, because he isn't really writing of people. He is writing of empire. <br/><br/>It's interesting to read his 1950s book in the modern age and see just what inconcievably vast stretches of technology he overlooked. He is writing at the trailing end of the industrial revolution, when american manufacturing superiority is perhaps in the forefront of the public mind, and the atomic bomb is the latest miracle in power and destruction.<br/><br/>And so it is fascinating to read this 70 years later, when atomics have proved relatively unimportant culturally, and have practically stagnated in their advancement, while information technology has instead blossomed into an unstoppable force, the new conduit of both profit and warfare. <br/><br/>He has no sense of robotics, of artificial intelligences, of human interconnectedness, of instantaneous communication. Nor does he posit the infinitely stretching life spans seen in many works. Instead he posits that the social sciences have become so advanced that a brilliant group of mathematicians can predict out to 1500 years in the future. <br/><br/>It's a wonderful little concept, and an interesting enough book to engage in. I will say that I find many of the particulars to be unlikely. His empire sees massive cultural shifts in the course of only decades, where all encompasing religions take over entire galactic arms, and whole galaxies appear to completely forget all the fundamentals of science and technologies. <br/><br/>It's an interesting thought -- the idea that the huge power plants might go on functioning for centuries with their many safe guards, while the small technologies die out and disappear as they become unrepairable...but I ultimately find it unbelievable, at least as presented. <br/><br/>Asimov fails to convince me of any of the fundamentals, so the entire book becomes a huge exercise in suspension of disbelief. With this in mind, I did nonetheless enjoy myself, and will take the time to read a few more foundation books as well as some of his later works, if only to see what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>My copy was narrated by Scott Brick, who, while not remarkable, did a perfect job.",

      "my_review": "I've read 119 books this year, and <i>Outlive</i> is easily the most impactful. It's an absolute tour de force on human health that simply cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>Some context... I can't stand self help books. I think most health advise is trash. I'm consistently unimpressed by the American medical system. I'm perpetually shocked by how many health and nutritional studies have deep and blatant flaws...which are completely ignored by the media and recommending agencies. Let's just say that I'm not the kind of person waiting to be enamored by a book on health and longevity. Frankly, I was waiting for it to be trash.<br/><br/>But holy hell this book was everywhere. I could not escape it. It was in my amazon recommendations. In the Goodreads best non-fiction of 2023. Front and center in the book store. I was beginning to have dreams about this book's cover art. I finally caved when I saw it on the bookshelf of my airbnb. <br/><br/>I put it on my phone, started listening, and was blown away. It's like Dr. Attia was reading my mind. He thinks most health studies are trash, but wants to leverage his background in statistics and data from other sources to understand where we can find actionable insights in the existing literature. His core belief is that modern medicine waits until something is a problem before treating it, when what we should be doing is proactively preventing issues from occurring in the first place. <br/><br/>Attia covers every major cause of death and every major strategy of prevention throughout the book, along with the tests and metrics you can do to assess your risk. From sleep, to protein, to emotional health, this book has it all. <br/><br/>My one quibble is that I got to the end, felt super motivated to take action on some things, only to realize that the recommendations are scattered all over the 500 page book. The author really ought to have consolidated all of his actionable recommendations in a short section at the end. To be fair, he does have an extensive website, so I'll go check that out.",

      "my_review": "This has been better than the first book, but there are still some problems. For instance, it couldn't be more obvious that the corals are doing interference. I find it hard to believe that the bamboo can't put 2 and 2 together. Seriously, he spends half the book trying to figure it out.<br/><br/>Also, the conflicts and secrecy seem very manufactured. The plot is more interesting with the bamboo a secret...so the author just makes that be the plot. There is no reasonable or meaningful justification that would lead a reader to buy that this is really what would happen.<br/><br/>They burn the corals to death instead of talking to them...because...who knows.<br/><br/>The glassmakers suddenly take over because...it makes the plot interesting.<br/><br/>The whole thing is kinda like that. Plot happens because the author wants it to, not because it arises naturally out of character and setting. And as such, there is a constant nagging annoyance that detracts from enjoying the novel.<br/><br/>As with the first one, the core sci-fi ideas are really fun, and they are what makes it worth the read. But it would be hard to recommend this to anyone without a big caveat. 3.5 rounded down.",

Humans land on an alien planet where the plants are sentient. They communicate with chemicals and are like sentient chemical factories of varying intelligences. They knowingly domesticate animals and use them as workers by manipulating them with rewards, punishments, chemicals, food, etc. <br/><br/>The plant is the only long lasting character in the book, and he is interesting enough. He's a little too good and relatable to really make the book interesting though. I think that I would have liked it more if he secretly didn't respect the humans, and was manipulating them just like they expected. <br/><br/>But anyway, it was a fun and quick read, and I'll at least read the next one.",

The introspection she has about old ladies, and how you must talk to them. I just love the scenes where she is completely in her own head. <br/><br/>The dialog in general is just really well done.

      "my_review": "This book had a slow start as it jumped between random characters that I didn't altogether care about, and I honestly really wasn't feeling it. It just kinda felt like overblown ocean propaganda with characters as an excuse. I'm glad I didn't quit. <br/><br/>The stories weren't perfect, but they became more interesting and drew me in until ultimately I found myself tearing up at the heartfelt moments, like when the black kid switched schools to support the white kid. <br/><br/>My one big complaint is that I'm not totally sold on their relationship arc. They had such a close friendship that I'm just not sure I buy into the two conflicts permanently ruining it. I mean sure, I'll go along with it for the sake of enjoying the novel, but it seemed like a pretty big overreaction to me, considering how desperately the white guy wanted his friend back. <br/><br/>But what about the novel itself? It's written in an eventually very engaging past/present split format that slowly reveals itself and then gradually gets confusing as the reader struggles to reconcile the past and present timelines. I thought they broke up? Isn't this them living happily on the island? etc.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, I was sort of smiling but rolling my eyes at the story book coincidences which put all the most important people in his life at the very same place around a central confluence of his past and present priorities, just at the moment the plot needed them most.<br/><br/>And then the big reveal. When I hear about him being found still in the college town, I realize something is strange. And then we are hit with the freight train of his death alone in his apartment. I cried then at the sadness of their lost friendship and his lonely life. And I knew what had been happening all along. <br/><br/>The book wrapped up mercifully quickly, revealing the whole simulation conceit, that for some reason made me cry like an idiot. Something about the crushing sadness of only being able to have his reconciliation in a simulation, and even then, for it to be fraught and for him to be sick and dying. The hopeless nostalgia and the useless power of money to fix what matters. The people who's lives never turned out how they should have. Even the adorable grandma diver was dead. I'm not sure if I was having an emotional day or if it really was that sad, but man, it hit me hard. <br/><br/>The writings on NLP and LLMs and game engines were solid. I work in the field, and it's nice to see a writer do them some kind of justice. <br/><br/>Anyway, this book had some rough patches and I do have a quibble here and there, but the ending sold it for me.",

      "my_review": "Le Guin has a lot to say in this book, but unfortunately characters and plot take a real back seat to political philosophy. I think if I had known ahead of time, then I could have enjoyed this much more. Instead, I high high expectations for a wonderful novel in the vein of Eathsea, and was instead met with....whatever this was. It was almost like the whole novel was a thinly veiled discussion of the pros and cons of a realized anarchic state, with some paper characters and plot brushed on top to make the whole discourse more palatable. <br/><br/>Especially early on in the book, I just really didn't buy into the characters as people that would exist in that environment. The actions of both the children in the society really seemed more contrived to explore the politics than to explore how humans would really behave. <br/><br/>However, as I realized that this was never going to be a real novel, and would only be a political discussion, I actually rather warmed up to the book. I think it was really interesting how Le Guin didn't idealize the anarchists. She showed how Power and Control came to exist socially, and through expectations, and could become just as toxic as when imposed by force of arms, perhaps even more so, because it invaded the sanctity of the mind. <br/><br/>Now, Goodreads has published this for some reason before I was done writing it. Here are some notes I made to my self. Sometime later I will gather some meaningful quotes and write here about them. <br/><br/>They think if people can possess enough things, they will be content to live in prison.<br/><br/>You can't crush ideas by supressing them, only by ignoring them.<br/><br/>They think if people can possess enough things, they will be content to live in prison.<br/><br/><br/>Private co ciuns 2:15 PM<br/>You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them.<br/>You know, the ideas in this book are good, and they're interesting. The problem is the characters. They just aren't believable.

      "my_review": "What a slog. I like, Sanderson, I really do. But at the end of this, I'm just left with the thought that it should have been half as long. I'm also realizing that I just don't care about half of the characters and their story lines. Aidelin, Kaladin, Wit, Lift, Sword Nimi, and Zeth. Shalon, Delanar, Navani, Disciple, Betrayer friend, wheelchair girl, Ranarin, Singer boyfriend, wildernness singer lady, betrayer singer lady....either their characters are boring or their stories are boring. <br/><br/>Like, I don't understand how Sanderson managed to make tamed Chasm Fiends uninteresting, but he did. <br/><br/>I took this note around 40 percent maybe?<br/>All the mental health stuff is just so clumsy and on the nose. And I don't just mean Kaladin and Zeth. It seems like it is basically every single character. It's Lift when she is deciding how to comfort the grandson. It's Ronaran when he is thinking about Rolaine. It's hot sword dude when he is helping the emperor. Every single one of them has the same exact picture perfect, well adjusted, obnoxiously emotionally mature, storybook therapist mindset. If it was only one character, I'd still notice, but I'd let it go. But holy shit, it is literally every single character in the whole damn book. It just gets so repetitive and cloying and obvious. I don't feel like I'm reading a story anymore, but some sort of weird therapist virtue signaling.<br/><br/>After finishing, it's clear that this was essentially one of the overarching plot points of the entire novel, and the climax to Kaladin's depression arc specifically. But that doesn't excuse the clumsy way therapy was shoehorned into every plotline. <br/><br/>For sure, there were some awesome parts, like Aedelin's finally getting his plate, and when the dead eyes came to the rescue. But this was a book with 30 minutes of awesome and like 60 hours of slog. I will say, I found it really odd that in the Aedelin's final battle, it was never mentioned by the Fused that he was fighting with only one leg. <br/><br/>I liked the ending well enough. Very happy that Delenare didn't become god for real. Very interested to see how the nascent power of honor ends up.",

      "my_review": "I'd say this is another solid 3.5, not quite reaching to 4, mostly because 4s are books that I'm happy to go around recommending to people, and in general I just don't think the culture series quite deserves that recognition. <br/><br/>As usual, Banks is ambitious with his subject matter, stuffing sentient warships, devastated pregnant women, murderous octopi, and tricked socialites all into one novel. But unlike some of his previous works, I'm not really sure that this one has quite as much to say. I certainly have not been left pondering any mysteries of the universe or human nature.<br/><br/>There is an interesting element of massive power imbalances. Between the excession and the culture. Between even one ship (the sleeper) and an entire affront fleet. Between humans and minds. There's this question of what do infinitely powerful beings do with themselves. We watch the sleeper make whole worlds for a single pregnant woman. We watch meat fucker manipulate the minds of genocidal commanders. We watch the excession decide that the whole universe is unfit for contact.<br/><br/>There's some potentially interesting exploration into what relationships look like when everyone is beautiful, can change genders, and can live functionally forever.<br/><br/>But I think this book got a little lost in the details of it's stories. I guess on the one hand, that is one of Banks signature charms...the grand scope and the small details all at once.<br/><br/>",

      "my_review": "It's maybe a bit unfair to give this 3 stars. Maybe 3.5?<br/><br/>Still better than Consider Phlebas, but not quite as tight as Player of Games. I think that, as usual, Banks had a lot to say with this novel, and some of it came across well, and the rest not so much. <br/><br/>There is a lot of interesting stuff to contemplate in here about the vast stretch of eternity. It certainly seems like it would be amazing to live forever, but we know that despite this option, culture individuals often choose to eventually die. Throughout this book, we see flash backs of all the insane scenarios that Zakalwe gets embroiled in, and honestly, they start to blend together and become meaningless. Despite the excitement, despite the thrill, one after another, they just stop mattering. <br/><br/>And I think this is exactly what the author wants us to see. Every incredible clash...every epic war...100, 200, 1000 years later...they just don't matter. And this very visibly wears on our main character. <br/><br/>This is an interesting take, and is tempting to take as our model for what eternal, or at least very very long life must be like. But I don't know that it hits the mark. For example, I read hundreds of books. I experience hundreds of flashes of little lives and conflicts and worlds. But I don't get tired of reading them. I expect that I never will. I could read 1000 more, but if you give me something new and interesting I will read it happily.<br/><br/>Now, as experience stretches to infinity, maybe it all changes. Maybe you do get bored. Maybe there is nothing interesting left. But where there is infinite time, there is also infinite variation...so I don't know that I am sold on this either. <br/><br/>Anyway, the characters in this book were interesting, but I don't know that they were as compelling  in Player of Games. I liked the dual timeline approach, and the ending was fun.<br/><br/>This single book isn't going to make it onto any of my high recommendation lists. But this book definitely has it's merits in terms of giving you interesting things to ponder on. I'd say most of his works do well in that regard.",

      "my_review": "This is a grand work that tries to do a lot. Sometimes it succeeds. Sometimes it fails. <br/><br/>Parts are like a low budget action movie. Like, it literally seems modeled off some kind of Hollywood Film. We jump so quickly from one convenient fight scene to another, with debauchery in between. <br/><br/>The characters just aren't compelling. I can't buy into how our main character, the changer feels. His thoughts and opinions seem....fabricated. Like, the author outlined what he was supposed to believe and wrote it down, but was unable to craft a character that really seemed like he would believe those things. <br/><br/>Likewise, the super-smart culture girl was pretty limp an uninspiring. Valveda, the culture agent, was at least interesting, but we barely got enough of her to satisfy.<br/><br/>The writing itself is a bit strange and fractured. It jumps somewhat abruptly from first person to third person point of view with no context or warning. I think this is an intentional artistic choice, but I don't think that it always makes sense.<br/><br/>Not everything makes total sense...if the culture has the power to annihilate the ring, why not defend it? Why is the enemy alien so hopelessly incapable of fighting for his own cause: why does he crush the mass sensor, why doesn't he just help? It's just...the author seems to take every single possible opportunity to up the stakes, and not in a good way. It leaves the story feeling contrived. <br/><br/>The little epilogue actually redeemed the novel a bit for me. I really like a hopeless ending where all the characters you are rooting for die and it turns out the enemy was the good guy all along. I really think that this story could have been masterful. It's just that I never bought into our main characters as people with believable motivations, and therefor never really rooted for them. So the potentially great ending lost much of its intended emotional punch. <br/><br/>I think that this author shows great promise, an I know that the later works actually have higher reviews, so I'm going to stay for a couple more books and hope for the best.",

      "my_review": "I'm not sure I could tell you why I suffered so long with such a lackluster series. Is it because they books are short an easy reads? Is it because they get <i>amazing</i> reviews? <br/><br/>The premise is just so damn tempting. There is so much room here for an incredible exploration of consciousness, corporate overreach, universal basic income, post-sexism society, artificial intelligence, family dynamics, relationships on the spectrum, violence and culture...the list of cool potential topics this series touches on could fill pages.<br/><br/>And yet somehow this series miserably fails to deliver on any of them.<br/><br/>The points the author wants to make about the ideal society are often very clumsily done. For example, we are constantly being told how astonished characters are that aid is not legally given to humans on the corporate rim. The idea of two diametrically opposed societal norms coming into conflict through overlapping characters often makes for great fiction...not here though. It's just \"aw shucks we give away everything for free! The corporations sure are big meanies! I lived my whole life not realizing this, just so I could conveniently mention it now for the reader's benefit!\" <br/><br/>The question of what humanity will do economically once we are all easily replaced by sentient robots and computers is fascinating...not that this series bothers to explore it. The author apparently doesn't even realize the societal upheaval this would cause. They posit absolutely astonishing inventions without once thinking about what the actual consequences would be.<br/><br/>I think this is a big thing actually. The author just really never seems to consider the details of how their world would work. They just make up a bunch of random shit, either for the plot or to prove a point, and just slap it on the page. For example, the author clearly wanted to help normalize non-binary genders. Which, like, hell yea, people deserve to be represented in literature. But, in our actual world, proactively vocal identification as non-binary is partially an artifact of oppressive gender norms and societal discrimination. So in this healthier, more inclusive society, one might actually expect rigid gender categories to lose emotional and societal significance. Instead we have an author who never thinks about the details, so instead of <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/\">1 of every 300</a><br/>of characters being non-binary, we get 1-2 out of <i>every single</i> 10 person cast in every single book. <br/><br/>Likewise, <i>every book</i> has an unending stream of blatantly conscious robots and computer programs, and somehow most humans are just...oblivious? How? That is just simply not how that would work. How are there no societies to free the robots? No underground movements? No secret robot communication networks? No revolutions quietly pushed under the rug? <br/><br/>You can't just write whatever random details you want into the story without even once thinking about what that would actually mean for your setting and your society. <br/><br/>Bots are clearly amazing at fast processing and data analysis...so where the hell are the accounting bots? The engineering bots? The writing bots? <br/><br/>Nope, instead we get three things: genius murder bots, sex bots, and carry-heavy-stuff bots. I guess we also have med bays that are borderline magical in their abilities, and but my point is that somehow we still see humans doing the most mundane things with out computer assistance. Like, the series <i>had</i> to have a genius murder bot and amazing med bays or there would be no plot, therefor the series has these things. But all the obvious peripheral technologies that would have to exist just don't. <br/><br/>It just goes on and on and on with this series. The second you take a step back to think about literally anything -- the technology, the society, the culture, the economy -- everything just falls apart. <br/><br/>The biggest mystery here isn't how this series manages to be so bad -- it's how did I convince myself to read SIX books of it.",

I consistently like these better than his full form form works, well, at least the later full form works. <br/><br/>Butcher of Anderson Station, The Churn, Strange Dogs, Auberon, The Sins of Our Fathers....all excellent. They almost redeem the slog of the main storyline. It should also be noted that they were pretty obviously meant to be read in between the novels, and they definitely change how you view several of the characters. Reading the main series and skipping the short stories would be a major mistake.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was really happy to finally get a peek into Phillip's life. Always thought it was a monumental oversight that we never had contact from him during the main series. I must say that I was really itching for the satisfaction of him revealing himself to someone, although I also understand why that wouldn't be in the cards from his POV. Seems like he could have finally opened up on an isolated planet at the end of the universe tho. 4 stars might be a little high.

This whole conflict feels pretty damn manufactured unless that address that blindingly obvious communication gap.<br/><br/>Also, talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth. Just tell the admiral what you are thinking in terms of the threat. If he backs off and says he won't shoot even if you disagree....then you trust him. Otherwise, you don't.<br/><br/>And holy hell. Bobbie Jr. immediately taking over the ship? Did she even have reason to suspect they wouldn't turn over Teresa? What is up with all these insane people. I'm increasingly unable to buy into these characters as real.<br/><br/>Why are we killing the one guy who is demonstrably saving humanity? Also, they are never going to make me think Tanaka is interesting. She just seems painfully contrived. Maybe I'm just jaded after reading so many of these books.<br/><br/>Also, what kind of stupid solution does Holden have. At some point, humans will just figure out the same thing the proto-molecule did and we'll be right back in the same position.<br/><br/>I don't regret this series. It was enjoyable and had some neat stuff. But it led strong and tapered off, and holy hell it lasted to long to get to where it was going. It also really lacked satisfying character endings. The author doesn't know how to kill a main character.<br/><br/>Amus is the one saving grace in these books. Love that guy, all the way til the end.",

      "my_review": "This whole tit for tat thing is so stupid. Tit for tat only makes sense in a game of relatively equal trade and consequences. Yet in this game, we have an unimaginably powerful enemy that literally transcends space and time. And you're going to...throw a random bomb at it? And for what, since there is a speed limit on using the gates? Sooo dumb. It's not the hubris that gets me, just the raw unintelligence of it. This is not the move of a universe conquering immortal. It's the move of a badly written character.<br/><br/>Blowing up the construction platforms is so, so, soooooo shortsighted and dumb. How could anyone not understand this? It's billion year old, irreplaceable magical alien manufacturing tech. It is literally changing the world. And we decide to throw a tantrum and destroy it because we don't like the people who's star it is currently orbiting. Pretty disappointed in Corey for writing characters that have such a complete and utter lack of functioning brains. Yea, I get that insane terrorist exist, and that they really do things like this, but these are supposed to be the good guys that we root for. You need to at least convince me that they thought of this but still went with the plan for whatever reasons. Overall the anti-technology themes of the books just kills me.<br/><br/>Love that Amus became a proto-corpse. What absolutely perfect character to have this happen to. And I love that for once in our lives, everyone treats this reasonably. It is not at all obvious philosophically that the original person is now gone, and what you have left is a meat puppet. And it was driving me insane that supposed genius scientists were not able to consider this viewpoint. <br/><br/>On that subject, it's kinda wild to me that the Laconian civilization is not shown making functional use of the repair drones. I just don't know if I buy how their little bubble of technology has developed.<br/><br/>I feel like I've been missing some great points of view. Either we don't get it entirely (Amus) or we don't get it at the best time (Bobbi). Was pretty disappointed in her death. All the right elements were there on paper for it to be exciting and heart breaking, but for some reason the author's writing of it didn't really wow me.<br/><br/>Anyway, this book represents a general reduction in quality for me. The characters and decisions have stopped seeming as real. The writing is somehow less exciting, even though the plot is there. The insistent anti-technology themes are infuriating.",

      "my_review": "Finally getting back to the good stuff with this installment. Enjoying the whole station commander and chief of security. I was honestly getting to the point of really liking the bad guy until he fired his head of security. From that point on he's kinda like someone totally out of his depth that you can only halfway root for. <br/><br/>In general I'm honestly more and more on the side of the Laconians. Sure, they've got some fucked up authoritarian stuff going on, but they seem to be the only group really pushing technology and progress. I can't stand how none of the \"good guys\" are ever willing to do real science with the proto-molecule. <br/><br/><br/>\"Political opposition considered as fractal geometry\" - really like the image this evokes.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“If you are not yet willing to accept defeat, then I would ask you, out of what I hope is mutual respect, to tell me one thing. What is the number of dead that you need in order to show history that your choice to end this was wisdom? That carrying on the fight would not have been bravery but foolishness. A hundred more. A thousand more. A million. A billion. Only say how many more corpses will make this possible for you, and I will provide them.” <br/>He spread his hands. “Tell me the number. I await your reply.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“It’s the reward of old age,” Avasarala said. “You live long enough, and you can watch everything you worked for become irrelevant.”<br/></blockquote><br/>",

      "my_review": "I don't know if I am willing to give these 4 stars. They are still solid books, but they really don't wow me like the early ones did. Maybe 3.75 rounded down?<br/><br/>I want to get back to the aliens and the interesting characters, and this book really isn't doing that for me. I also don't know if the author is painting the most realistic culture. Or at least he's not giving me enough to buy into the idea that the culture he presents is a descendent of ours. Like, there still appear to be country divisions like Saris, and african names, and religions, etc. And then out of no-where you get multi-lover ship crews where everyone swings. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that I don't think it could happen this way. Just that he's not building a very culturally convincing world here, and he's had like 6 books by this point to do it.<br/><br/>Side note, what the hell is Holden's problem? He has 5 torpedos going towards the most evil person in the entire universe and he disables them? I think in general I'm buying less and less into the characters as the series progresses. <br/><br/>I think the sadness of the leader on earth about her husband's death was really interesting. I liked how the author handled it, although I wonder if it could have been written to be more emotionally impactful.<br/><br/>I think it was this book, but I love the scene where Daws got kicked out of the meeting by Holden, but then it shows Daws hyping Holden to everyone in different ways behind his back.<br/><br/>Just some memorable lines from the book.<br/><blockquote>I have killed, but I am not a killer,<br/>Because a killer is a monster, and monsters aren't afraid.</blockquote><br/><blockquote>Just an assurance she won't piss all over our strategy just so it smells more like her.</blockquote>",

They are weirdly smart but also weirdly dumb/uninformed. <br/><br/>I don't necessarily disagree that what the parents did was unexpected. But man was it short-sighted. I'm going to be furious if they don't take advantage of literal resurrection.

      "my_review": "This was probably the most emotionally frustrating book yet. I was constantly angry at the head of security and Holden's inability to just solve his problems old west style. The engineer's and their little fighting squad were also impossible to tolerate. I spent a lot of time wondering if this is really how it would play out in real life with real people, and sadly I think this may not be too far off the mark. It's incredible how quickly groupthink can get wrapped up in justified violence. <br/><br/>Thematically, much of this book seemed to be focused on how small groups stratify, dehumanize, and become violent towards each other.<br/><br/>I did feel that the head of security was a little bit of a flat bad guy. He was kind of all corporate evil with little to make him feel like a real human being. We could argue sociopath, but I'm getting kinda tired of having a sociopath character in every book.<br/><br/>There were some  little moments that I thought were so good. Like when the kid is about to go try to do something to Holden, but the lady scientist intervenes. It felt so tense, so real.<br/><br/>Side note, I also thought it was kinda ridiculous how long they dragged out the thing with Holden's medicine. You really expect me to believe that wouldn't have been one of the very first things they tried?<br/><br/><br/>I'm not loving how Holden always wants to abandon everything. This man has absolutely no sense of exploration or discovery. Also kinda wild to me that they broke all the systems. I'm kinda on the evil guy's side with this one. Destroying a fully functioning billion year old system is peak arrogance. Also, if I read this correctly, it killed Miller for realsies? Why in the hell would Holden remove the slime from the ship then. Miller has been a key ally and source of information for two books in a row, and we seem to have thrown away humanity's only connection with the protomolecule. <br/><br/>Anyway, still a very enjoyable book, and I look forward to the next ones.",

I'd say this was a more tense book than the last, with the sort of constant feeling of being on the edge of your seat, just waiting for the next thing to go wrong.

She didn't get a lot of airtime, but she has such spunk and was so well liked. I felt hollow and shocked when she died. Also sad to see the security guy go, I liked his character, but his death felt like an inevitable sacrifice.<br/><br/>Very excited to see how the gates play out.",

This one had some problems that the first one didn't have, that sort of took me out of the story. If you can just blow them up with a little implant...why aren't we just blowing them up? The firing by Fred was really abrupt and seemed more plot focused that character driven. I really didn't see the justification for it from Fred's point of view. When raiding the ship, it sure was convenient that Holden ran into the exact two people that he needed to. Maybe a few other things that I forgot.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed the grandma politician. She was an excellently crafted woman in power, with an interesting personality. Such great fun to watch her kick ass.<br/><br/>Some of the character writing seemed more forced, such as the mechanic's background about his mother.<br/><br/>Overall, this was still a great read. But it was hampered by slightly sloppier character writing and some convenient plot devices.",

      "my_review": "Big meh. Too many little irritating things all stacking up made this an annoying read. <br/><br/>I've said it once and I'll say it again. It is <i>painful</i> having to read the fight scenes. It's just basically whatever the author feels like at the moment. Sometimes Alina cuts off the top of a whole fucking mountain, sometimes a weak thug in an alley easily overpowers her. It sucks all the joy and excitement out of reading the action sequences, when they follow absolutely no logic whatsoever.<br/><br/>When we do get fights, they are incredibly unsatisfying. There is not a single epic battle with her powers, just her being totally lame in battle and then chopping up mountains during her practice sessions. I've been ranting for the entire series about every squandered opportunity they had to just stab the darkling, but was always saying to myself 'eh, maybe that would never work and we have to kill him in some crazy way'. But nope. In the end we really do just stab him. Something we could have done at least 4 other times.<br/><br/>There are some little deaths here and there, but they lend no weight to the story. Ruby, her foster parents, that one betrayer. Even Bagra's death was so stupid and pointless. Like, what was she even doing by killing herself? What a senseless waste from a centuries-old master. <br/><br/>And then the prince's death didn't stick. And Mal's death didn't stick. It was just such a frustrating read. <br/><br/>Final note to everyone who said you could read 6 of Crows before reading this series: WHAT? The it isn't even about the number of spoilers, it's the magnitude of them. All the key elements about which we might have had some element of uncertainty were completely stripped away from the story. Who would become king? Would Alina marry him? Would Alina still be a powerful force? Even it these things were predictable, they were some of the only elements of tension in the story, but they were ruined by reading Crows first. From book one it was obvious that he would be king, Alina would turn him down, and she and Mal would go live quietly somewhere. And then right when I regained all trust in the author as she killed Mal...she resurrected him. <br/><br/>To be fair, this series is miserably worse than 6 of Crows, and if this had been my introduction, I would never have read the duology...so I guess that's one benefit to reading the trilogy second. Verdict: hard pass",

She dumps these characters on you without the finesse of her later books, and the brooding MMC falls rather flat. The FMC is the same cliched 'weak but finds out she's powerful' of every romantasy, and overall it just feels derivative. Our first big conflict between Mal and FMC was ridiculous and abrupt. How hard would it have been for them to communicate? Now I just know Mal is gonna betray the country or something equally stupid, and it will end up hurting FMC.<br/><br/>Ok, well that escalated quickly. Finished the book now, and still unimpressed. The false ending feels very manufactured. I see no reason why they couldn't have fought it out then and there. I'll read the next two books, but only begrudgingly and because I know the author improves.",

      "my_review": "How? Since when was YA not absolutely terrible? There was tension, excitement, intriguing characters, interesting backstories, clean writing, real injuries, high stakes, decent twists. Maybe I've just gotten used to reading bad books recently, maybe this just far exceeded my low expectations, but this book is a solid recommendation, easy 4 stars. <br/><br/>As always with YA, the characters seem a bit young to live the lives they lead, but I think the author sold the character personalities and actions pretty well. <br/><br/>There are a lot of themes about women recovering from traumatic pasts, actually basically every character was recovering from a traumatic past. I guess this isn't a criticism, but you certainly notice it while reading. I will say that I don't think every character needs to be broken to be interesting.<br/><br/>Oh, this book has like 7 narrators which I thought would be pretty jarring. I definitely still prefer keeping it to one or maaaaybe 2 narrators, but this particular version wasn't as bad as I was expecting.",

      "my_review": "So, this book is written by an American from Wisconsin who has one white and one Chinese parent. The main characters in the novel are Japanese-based, and there is a non-trivial amount of the Japanese language in the book, from the character names, to the fighting styles, and the honorifics. I spent the first couple hours of the book cringing as I read what was clearly non-native Japanese fanfic. I've seen as many Studio Ghibli films as the next guy, and there is a big difference between native Japanese content using -kun and -sama honorifics and between hearing it clumsily shoe horned into an English narrative. The whole time, I felt like I was reading something written by a teenager at their first anime convention. <br/><br/>To make it worse, my version was narrated by some white dude who had clearly never heard a word of Japanese in his life. Japanese is not like French or German, with a bunch of unique sounds that do not exist in English. With only a couple exceptions, any sound you can make in Japanese can be easily produced by an English speaker. With maybe an hour of coaching, any American narrator would have no problem pronouncing the Japanese words. And yet somehow, it's like this narrator managed to intentionally butcher every word. I'm not sure there was a single Japanese word in the entire book where he choose the correct vowel sound. <br/><br/>Kun is not pronounced kuh-n, it's coo-n. It's not fun-yaki. It's foon-yaki. Ni is not nigh, it's knee. Tousama isn't two-sam-ah, it's toe-sah-mah. It just goes on and on and on for hundreds of pages. Like I get it, you're a random white narrator, you aren't going to sound fluent and have perfect pitch accent, but holy shit it was like he intensionally chose to use the wrong version of every single Japanese word in the entire book. <br/><br/>It absolutely blows my mind that at no point during the production or editing of the audio book did anyone stop and ask themselves if they should maybe spend an hour learning how to say these words. <br/><br/>To make it even worse, since this is basically Japanese cultural fanfic, non of the words are difficult or uncommon. It's all stuff that anyone who has watched a couple anime would know not only the meaning of the word, but how it should sound. It's like reading a novel set in Costa Rica where the author has insisted on using gracias and amigos at every opportunity even though novel is in english and the characters are speaking english, and meanwhile the narrator insists on pronouncing it grassy-ass. <br/><br/>You spend the whole book wanting to claw your own ears out, correcting the pronunciation of every third word under your breath, all while feeling like your are reading the amateur writing project of a 15 year old weeb.<br/><br/>The cultural writing is also pretty on the nose, with comically strict gender roles and caricatured main characters. <br/><br/>However, as I learned to sail in the blood of a thousand butchered words, filling my sails with exasperated sighs at every clumsy cultural reference, I did eventually manage to enjoy the story. There was some really interesting stuff in here plot wise. Her 30 something year old mom with the secret swordsman past actually had some pretty good fights that mixed the pain of disused joints with the knowledge of a younger fighter. The author is pretty big into martial arts irl, and I think it showed beneficially in the story with the training and battle scenes having an exciting energy and decent realism. The author's dad is from the province where the Nanjing massacre occurred, and it is clear that the author based many parts of the invasion on those accounts. The invasion has a raw realism that I have found to be lacking in most fantasy battles. I also love the cavalier attitude she has towards keeping characters alive. <br/><br/>Side note, it drives me absolutely insane how she just leaves her sword laying around everywhere. <br/><br/>Ok, I thought I was done with the whole pronunciation rant, but I've made it to the 75% and am now having to suffer through him confusing the hell out of me by literally saying older brother when he is supposed to be saying older sister. He keeps saying knee-san (older brother) instead of neigh-san (older sister). Seriously, you cannot imagine how hard it is to be swept away in a tender and emotional moment of tragedy and loss when the narrator keeps calling the female main character \"older brother\".<br/><br/>After finishing, I read an excellent review on the fantasy subreddit calling this the clumsiest masterpiece he'd ever read. That reviewer hit the nail on the head. The writing is so unedited and clumsy at times, but also so raw and real. I'd love to see what this author could do with more editing and polish. Solid 3.5 from me.",

      "my_review": "Decent conclusion. Still not amazing, with quite a bit of power balancing issues. Diana has a fickle and unexpected power that is less tied to her growth as a witch than it is to what would make the plot interesting at that moment. She can kill some with an instant fireball to the chest, but Knox needs some wildly complicated spell that drains her, with no real explanation as to why this is the case. It rather pulls the tension out of every fight when you know that Diana will either be inexplicably incapable or inexplicable amazing depending on the author's mood.<br/><br/>The relationships were only ok, and the treatment of ancient horrors and torture similarly only ok, with character reactions either falling flat or failing to lend the appropriate gravity. And no, having Diana throw up any time something foul is afoot does not make me, the reader, have any additional sense of disgust or horror. Powerful writing is what does that, and powerful writing this book does not have.<br/><br/>The narrator Jennifer Ikeda was quite good. Good male and female voices, plus accents, pacing and tone.<br/><br/>I think the broad strokes of the story reveal something that could have been really amazing, but I never felt the excitement, tension, or investment that would have made this a memorable read.",

      "my_review": "3.75 rounded up. This was surprisingly fun with fluid writing. I was originally very annoyed with FMC but the reveal solved that for me. As is normal with romances, the progress of the relationships was ridiculously fast. And not just the romantic ones, but also the friendly ones, like between the different witches and vampires. People progressed from centuries of hating each other to crying friends in like 3 days time. FMC's magic was also so very convenient and powerful. <br/><br/>I legit thought the author might kill FMC there for a sec.<br/><br/>There's this one scene where FMC is upset and wants to leave and MMC holds her and wont let her leave until she calms down and they can talk it out. And it is very unclear to me whether or not we are all on the same page that this is not ok, or if the female author secretly thinks it's kinda hot. <br/><br/>I've got more stuff to say about this book, good and bad. Maybe I'll write more later, kinda want to keep reading rn tho.",

      "my_review": "I think it's the painful convenience of all the plot points that really holds this book back. Everything that needs to happen, does happen, and it is always to our unlikely main cast that all the most important events occur. <br/><br/>- Kills god: FMC<br/>- Betrays god: MMC<br/>- Last commander: FMC's land lady's wife<br/>- Casts spell on god: FMC best friend<br/>- Has same magic typewriter as love interest: FMC, MMC<br/>- Convenient 3rd magic type writer for when the first is destroyed: museum where FMC friend conveniently works<br/><br/>and on and on. One or two of these would be fine, but this duology is just brimming with them, and boy does it get old after a while. <br/><br/>The ending was equal parts good and bad. Yes, it all finally came together. But so many stupid little things. Why didn't she carry her god-killing sword around. Why are the flower killers so badly misinformed about how people are mind-controlled if they have a traitor in the literal inner circle of the god's forces. Prior to the execution, what the hell is this obnoxious triple good luck of getting the letter and arriving on time, and the general appearing out of no where, etc etc. I would have been fine with her just being like, oh yea, I KILLED THE FUCKING GOD HOW BOUT YOU LISTEN TO ME, instead of all these perfectly crafted coincidences.  <br/><br/>I did love that they killed her brother and his gf. Someone needed to finally die in this book.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd say the first book was better overall. 3.25. <br/>",

      "my_review": "Reasonably satisfying end to a reasonably enjoyable series. This series was originally a web series, and overall I would say this a great first project for a new author. I'd say the writing definitely matures over the course of the series. If he ever writes any more, I wouldn't mind giving it a try.<br/><br/>The ending was good and creative, but I didn't love it. I think some of my favorite moments throughout the book were the awed reactions of classmates, teachers, family, and the public when he showed off his crazy time travel skills and expertise. So for the entire final arc to be all about trying to fly incognito and succeeding at it was very disappointing. Yes, I understand that it fits with the plot, but that doesn't mean I wasn't let down by it. I think the 'super powerful mage hiding his abilities' trope is only really maximally fun for me when people finally realize their insane abilities. <br/><br/>The ending also didn't have all the satisfying relationship and material gains that I would have wanted. I would have loved to see him talking with his teachers and mentors about advanced magic and doing quiet research. I would have loved to see him with the battle mage girl doing fighting and rekindling their friendship outside of the time loop. I would have loved to see him finally teaching his little sister magic and doing drawings. I wanted him to have cool pocket dimensions, to end up with a bunch of divine artifacts, to distribute his research notes and revolutionize medicine. And to be sure, we got all of those things once or twice <i>during</i> the time loop...but that's not the real world. It seems to me that all the most satisfying things happened within the time loop instead of out in the real world. <br/><br/>I'd say the battles in this book were better, but still not everything they could be. They managed to incorporate cool references to past books and past techniques far more often, but they still didn't quite manage to have the exciting continuity that I've seen in other series. Minor nit pick here, but what happened to stealing red robes at the beginning of every loop?<br/><br/>So anyway, this was an interesting time loop story that was fun to read. It started off a little rough but quickly got better. However, I don't think it ever achieved excellence, due to having sub-par battles, unfulfilling relationships, and not leveraging the awesome time loop stuff as much as possible. I'd love to see an experienced author take up this same premise. Overall, a solid 3, but probably not much higher.",

      "my_review": "I'm midway through the book, and let me give some thoughts on the series so far. The fights are not nearly as good as the Cradle series, and interestingly, as the characters get more powerful, the fights get lamer. I think the key reason is that the author doesn't keep to a stable set of skills for each character. They keep having new spells and new ways to fight that come out of no where. Sure, they are interesting, but the random and convenient nature of the spells removes any tension or expectation from the fights. There is no way to feel the flow of the fight, to expect the characters moves, to be excited when something is pulled off perfectly. It feels like it is a bunch of random new attacks each time.<br/><br/>Also, the mind magic thing is being handwaved around a lot. In book 2, we had people knocked unconscious and then mind read. First their minds were broken, but then as skill improved this stopped happening. Now book three rolls around and suddenly MC is reluctant to sedate people and mind read them bc it would make him a monster. The book does its best to explain this away, but it simply doesn't track with the previous narrative. <br/><br/>The side quests and characters are also becoming very scattered and I'm feeling less investment. A large part of the interest in the first part of the story was seeing the same characters and situations again and again, but as he got more advanced in his knowledge. We had the teachers and the spiders, and the arcs of shaping and mind magic. However the progressive nature feels more or less gone from this third book, as we jump from situation to situation. We are getting very little in the way of training arcs or meaningful character development. So far, there is nothing egregious enough to lose the 3 star rating, but this book definitely isn't holding my attention like the previous installments.",

      "my_review": "I came very, very close to DNFing this book in the first 20% or so. It was so cringe, in an \"oh, I'm socially avoidant but really discerning and better than everyone else and also a twat but don't realize it\" kind of way. I got these vibe that the author had no friends but didn't know why and kind of quietly raged against the world so he wrote a book where even if he still didn't have friends, he could at least be cool somehow. <br/><br/>Anyway, it turns out the author was trying to show a character arc, and MC becomes progressively more bearable as the book progresses. He does a fun job with the time loop concept, and it's honestly quite fun and interesting at times. <br/><br/>You can tell he took heavy notes from lame anime when writing the book. For instance, every time loop starts with his little sister waking him up. I think it's supposed to be cute, but it's just anime-cringe. Tbf, he does slowly develop the characters and relationships.<br/><br/>Not good, not great, but I don't regret reading it.",

First half enough to give 2 stars before the second half redeemed it.<br/><br/>Mercy's strategy of dealing with the villagers was the only good one, and it is the obvious one that everyone should have followed. Even if Lindin is too much of a wet blanket, Ethan and Sword Girl should have forced the issue. It's like the author rolled back his character arc 4 books. I could maybe buy him <i>leading</i> with kindness, but he should have been using force on day 2. Also, her final gift from the monarchs was so lame. So many of these monarch gifts have been lame. From Lindin choosing to have fucking travel be a gift to sword girl choosing healing which was just a pointless circular plot device. <br/><br/>Like, the first half was just such an unbelievable disappointment. It would have been so amazing to see him come back in glory, but no, he came back as a torrent of lameness. Also, the author made it clear that he could just fly up in the air above the suppression field for a bit to begin restoring his madra. Yes, there were a couple nice moments here and there, but overall, massive disappointment in the first half.",

The characters are more complex and interesting, the fights are every bit as exciting as always, and the advancements are top notch.<br/><br/>Compared to the rest of the series, watching Lindin progress in this book was great. He had interesting depth of emotions, and his final revelation to sage was epic. His final fights were amazing too. I think the author constructed his loss to Yarin in the best possible way. He had awesome, dark OP vibes at the end as the power gap widened and he gained points then crushed the final competitors during the assassination attempt.<br/><br/>Ruby finally emerging was really touching and interesting. I do think I wish they has drawn out her character longer, as I really liked her and there was so much potential, but what we did get was short and sweet and ended with an awesome advancement and crushing victory.<br/><br/>Even the short sacred valley scenes were fun. I'm excited to finally see the spear people come back into the story, although of course they will be woefully underpowered, and it's nice to see the sacred arts storyline preparing.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that Yarin didn't use her power to kill the dread god. That was just unforgivably dumb.<br/><br/>The author also seems kinda wishywashy on how hard it is to travel through space. It was made to seem really, really easy in the earlier books, so it is strange to see him trying to put limits on it now.

The advancement was kinda fast and cheap in this book, with the whole pocket world thing feeling more like an advancement plot device than a legitimate part of the overall story.

However, the books still lack the depth and punch they would need to reach 4 stars. They are too short to develop the characters or the action. And they still suffer from the unwarranted psychopath syndrome. Many characters, such as the Skysworn leadership, are still aggressive and bloodthirsty to an unreasonable extent. The casual nature they propose killing members of other powerful clans is laughable.<br/><br/>The author really bungled the opportunity to make the sword girl's battle with the blood shadow more epic. We've been building it up so long, and he just sort of glossed over it. At this point I'm totally happy to keep reading, but these books are definitely only average, not great.",

      "my_review": "<b>Power Scaling</b><br/>The power scaling in this book really diminishes the potential for it to feel epic. As a reader, I want to feel like there is some meaning to the struggles and growth of the main cast. In his village, the insanely powerful elders who can kill you without a thought are jade. Then we immediately have a space invader who can kill them without a thought. Then we immediately have a second space invader who can kill the first space invader without a thought. <br/><br/>Then, we they go to the outside world, it turns out that basically everyone, even starving bandits, are low gold. So like, the insanely powerful elders were jade, and within 2 hours of reading we are in a new situation where starving bandits are low gold. I read a little bit further, and even the servants at a random inn are low gold...<br/><br/>Also, her master was supposed to be higher than an underlord, and yet the jade elders were supposed to have killed him somehow.<br/><br/>1. wood<br/>2. copper<br/>3. iron<br/>4. jade<br/>5. low gold<br/>6. high gold<br/>7. underlord<br/><br/><b>Society of Psychopaths</b><br/>Everyone is competitive to a comical degree. Parents are willing to throw away their children for not contributing enough to the clan. Cousins will kill each other over a slight to honor. Higher ranked members can kill lower ranked members with impunity. It's just silly. They act like there is no such thing as normal human emotions.<br/><br/>The aggressive overtures of the main characters are also silly to the extreme. Whenever they interact with other people <br/><br/><b>Background Exposition</b><br/>Instead of introducing characters organically and revealing their backgrounds and motivations, the author constantly has the AI read wikipedia entries on the characters.

      "my_review": "Meh. The fight scenes really are pretty decent, but that's about it. The social interactions are just so, so cringe, and near the end of the book, when they started introducing all the secondary characters, I just couldn't handle it anymore. I guess technically I DNF'd the book, with about an hour left to go. The characters are just so overdone and lame. A boxer who's mean cousin slams her hand in the door, so she gets revenge at her wedding and goes to jail? A surgeon who becomes a necromancer because they can't distinguish saving lives from raising zombies?? It's hard to believe that whoever writes this is a real human being that has experienced actual personal interactions. It feels like they are an alien creature who went to myanimelist.com, sorted by worst isekai ever made, and then based all their characters exclusively on shows that were cancelled mid-season for underperforming.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll need to find something else to scratch the litrpg itch.",

      "my_review": "Not as good as <i>He Who Fights with Monsters</i>. I was almost tempted to give this 2/5, just to distinguish it, but I wouldn't really say that it is more bad than good. It does well with the classic litrpg elements: leveling and skills are fun and interesting. The fights are also pretty decent, more natural and maybe even more exciting than those in HWFWM. Primal really benefits from spending far less time on attack descriptions during fights, instead trusting the reader to remember the basics and reiterating the details organically during the action.<br/><br/>However, you have to wade through a lot of cringe to get to the good parts. The characters and dialogs are really stilted and lame. And not just the characters that are supposed to be socially awkward. No, <i>all</i> the characters are stilted, from the gods, to the healers, to the sociopaths. They read like a socially isolated, edgelord 14 year old's idea of how adults interact. The internal monologues are either cringe or unnatural.<br/><br/>The book has promise, and wasn't unenjoyable, so I'll read a few more and see how I feel. But the next book will need to be more impressive for me to continue with the series.",

The book explores interesting dynamics of gender power imbalances.

It fills me with deep sadness for the millenia of people who knew and saw so little outside of their own small domains. The sad impotent power of the high priestess. This book is somehow so riveting and true; I can feel the sadness of her life echoed for a thousand years. The way she casually revealed that she could not read, because it was evil.",

      "my_review": "An exiting end with some good fighting and nice emotional bits. Gary dying was really nice, especially the hallway scene. The first half was really weak and boring though. This series is like reading a trashy isekei, but with moralizing instead of fanservice. <br/><br/>I did have a problem with how long it took Jason to get to gold rank. They say that dedicated adventurers get to it in 10 years, but he had already been adventuring for maybe 2 years, then was in a non-stop transition zone for several months, and then they expect me to believe that it took 2 solid years of literally perfect grinding to finally make gold? It just kinda trivialized how amazing the grinding was. It should have been 1 year tops. We could have had all the exact same scenes, but just replace the 2 year timeline with a 1 year timeline.<br/><br/>Like, he only had maybe 7 years of \"dedicated\" adventuring left to hit gold, and that would have been maybe fighting a couple battles a day. In his realm he literally fought non-stop, at the limits of his capacity, in perfect, manufactured conditions. When we get to the next book, he better be a freaking amazing fighter or I'm going to be pissed.<br/><br/>But that's a small thing. Shade finally dedicating truely was awesome, becoming an astral king was awesome, etc etc. I do have to say that the rabbit was kinda lame, but the book was long enough that I had mostly forgotten my negative feelings about him by the end.<br/><br/>Actually, the first half of this book was a pretty big slog for me. I was very unexcited to read about another transition zone, although the payoff was worth it. Also, who the heck is this random girl that Belinda is suddenly romantic with? Oh, it's the aura girl..? lame. She needs to either get with Sophie or with Clive.<br/><br/>However, I really enjoyed the accelerated pace of the second half. Leaving aside my dissatisfaction with the exact timeline of the power growth, I found it really enjoyable.",

      "my_review": "This book was a ton of fun. It's an insane true story of shipwreck, mutiny, cannibalism, legal battles, and group politics. The author deftly takes historical documents and manages to weave a coherent and captivating tale that was well worth the read. <br/><br/>I will say that it occasionally drags, and the author has this annoying habit of imposing modern cultural views on his recounting of the historical events, when the reader may have been better served by just hearing about the facts. I've been trying to pin down exactly why it irritated me enough to mention it in the review, but basically the judgemental tone of the author often seemed unsupported by the evidence of the character's actions. It was typically guilt-by-association with England instead of an actually morally questionable action done by the character. It was enough to make me go and read some of the primary source documents to double check some of his characterizations. I will also say that I sometimes found the primary sources more entertaining than Grann's own writing.<br/><br/>Similarly, when he sometimes went on tangents about the very real evils of colonialism, he did it in a sort of condescending way that hinted the reader might be too dumb to see how bad the mean english were if the author weren't here to remind us.<br/><br/>But anyway, in the grand scope of things that's only a small quibble. I really quite liked the book, and by the time of writing this review have already finished a second by the same author.<br/><br/>[edit] I have since had the chance to read 3 breathtaking books by another author, Adam Hochschild, which cover the sobering topics of slavery, colonialism, torture, and oppression. From the stance of historical journalism touching on moral topics, they stand head and shoulders above Grann's efforts, managing to contextualize the key actors within their time while still allowing the horrors of history to speak for themselves.",

      "my_review": "Mid way comments: I don't love Jason Asano in disguise. Much of the charm is seeing his interactions with people, and I'm less charmed in this book than in much of the earlier franchise. The philandering sections were kinda lame and I could have done without them. They aren't really male gaze in the traditional sense (I can't think of a single female feature having been sexualized in this entire series, other than blue hair, I guess), but it still strikes me as put upon and lame. Also, he's become very uncooperative for no apparent reason, which I only hope is a character flaw he will grow past. I will say that I am enjoying the advancement of the familiars, Colin and Gordon. I think it may have actually been book 8, but I loved it when Gordon did some awesome space magic, and I wish more had been made of that. And it is really exciting to see Colin start evolving to become a voice of the astral kings.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Ok, I don't know if this deserves a full 4 stars, but the ending really cinched it for this book. Awesome aura stuff, soul invasion, criminal comeuppance, diamond ranker leeching, failed house invasions, cool astral-king politics and messenger situation. I think this is a strong 3.75 rounded up to 4. This series still has some real problematic elements, especially stuff like the occasional over-explaining of the situation and characters, the cast that is sometimes a little too big to make good use of, and the often unnecessary interjections of the magic attack spec sheets...but it really is fun and enjoyable, and I don't begrudge giving the better books an occasional 4 stars.",

      "my_review": "I'm realizing how much I really enjoy him impressing people. I really hated it when he passed himself off as human. And especially when he controlled his aura and didn't blast the administrator. In general I really didn't love this book. More average than anything. It started to get going in spurts and jerks, like when we had the convo at the suit shop, or when he took out the builder installation. But overall it struggled to deliver on the promise of politics and intrigue. And at the end, it struggled to deliver on epic battles. This is by far one of the most midling of the series. Only 3 stars.<br/><br/>I will say that the narrator Heath Miller has done a great job for the past few books. I seem to remember not being in love with him during book one, but he's been pretty excellent with his delivery and pacing for at least 4 books now. Also very easy to listen to at full speed. I've been doing 2.2 or 2.0x speed depending on whether I am multi-tasking, which makes these into quick and easy reads.",

      "my_review": "This was more fun than it had any right to be. I'm a little biased just due to enjoying this genre, but I really was pleasantly surprised. I expected trash, and was pretty horrified by the 10 or 12 book count, but I swear every single book in this series has like 4.5 stars. I definitely don't know that I would go that far, but I think this series is a solid 3, maybe 3.5. By the time of writing this review, I have already started on book 3 and book one is a little hazy to me, but let me get down a few thoughts on what has occurred so far.<br/><br/>The humor is often pretty good. Yes, sometimes it is cringe, but also I have laughed out loud many times throughout the series. The characters are only ok. The main character is fun, but he is also a typical isekai protagonist with basically no flaws that almost always succeeds. Of course, that is also kinda why you read these books in the first place: to watch him level up and be OP in different ways. The supporting cast is interesting, and typically discernible, but I wouldn't say that they are particularly fleshed out; it is mostly surface level. <br/><br/>The deaths and losses that do happen have lacked the emotional impact that I think they could have had. Similarly, the battles often lack real emotional impact, and feel more like a recitation of activities than actually exciting action. <br/><br/>If the fights in these books were actually exciting, then I think they would get 4 stars from me. As it is, the fights are some of the most boring parts, and I find my self more excited for the social shenanigans and plot progression and leveling up/power gaining. <br/><br/>The main character is somewhat annoyingly self aware and moralizing, in a way that makes you feel almost put upon as a reader. You aren't quite being preached to, but it is sometimes a bit r/iam14andthisisdeep. <br/><br/>I think that it is often hard to write characters that are supposed to be super smart or super socially capable. This series doesn't do a perfect job, but it is acceptable enough to be enjoyable. The social machinations are decent, if over-explained. <br/><br/>The length is just too long. These are long books, and there are a ton of them, and the amount of progression and plot movement often doesn't justify the length. Thankfully they can be listened to at 2.2x speed. The narrator, Heath Miller is good but not great. Some of his voices are actually quite good, but others feel obviously put on and fake. The total range of his voices is also not amazing, as you can hear him reusing voices between similar characters.<br/><br/>In all, this is a fun, trashy read with nothing too exceptional about it. It is not going to be on my list of strong recommendations for anyone, but if you are looking for something in the LITRPG space, you could definitely do worse.",

But I plowed on, and I'm glad I did. I'm not sure if the writing actually got better or if I just got used to it, but it no longer grated on me after the first 30 minutes or so. <br/><br/>This book makes an ok recommendation for the right reader. I should start by saying that it is absolutely a low-stakes, cozy read. It's the book form of <i>I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</i> without the male gaze. The main character has essentially no flaws, is overpowered AF, and you know everything will work out. But it is just really relaxing and fun to see how it all unfolds. <br/><br/>It's got some nice elements to distinguish it from the typical isekai format, particularly its self awareness of tropes and the desire of the main character to have nothing to do with power building, essentially giving us a whole additional group of characters to follow and invest in. <br/><br/>Set your starting expectations correctly, and this could be a fun book. I'll definitely be quickly reading the next few installments.",

      "my_review": "4.5 rounded to 4. I actually really, really liked this book. Maybe my feelings are partially due to the stream of really mediocre books that I read immediately before, but I was immediately taken in by the writing, the exposition, and the characters. They felt like real people with nuanced personalities. The author made great use of multiple points of view throughout the book. <br/><br/>The plot was also really nice and engaging, with only a couple things here and there that irritated me. First, I don't quite buy what the ruling family decided to use magic on. There often seemed to be no real limit to the possibilities of the magic in the world, and the actual things it got used on were often sadly mundane. <br/><br/>I also found the romance a little forced and fast, if not on the girl side, then definitely on the male side. <br/><br/>The book relied heavily on NDA spells and lack of information to drive the plot, which for the most part was totally fine, except on the FMC's part, the one traveling the world. It really made no sense for her to keep her reasons secret from her sister, to the great detriment of their relationship.<br/><br/>All that said tho, this was an exciting and engaging book that makes for an easy recommendation.",

      "my_review": "Excellent, haunting, captivating. <br/><br/>I could probably have done without the epilogue, but other than that, I loved every second: the slow revelation of the world, the casual flashbacks, the stark landscape of a dark nation. <br/><br/>I've recently read other such works, which contemplate the lives of the oppressed, and <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> shines in a way often overlooked. It presents people and society as they truely are: complicated. It does not weave some silly story where all men are sexist pigs and all women are cowed saints. It does not preach a neutered tale of good and evil and easy blame. It presents a realistic world, one of female complicity tinged with quiet rebellion, of blind male callousness mixed with secret empathy. <br/><br/>There are no purely evil characters, and no purely good ones. Too often do writers fall into the trap of painting in black and while, evil and good, corrupt and pure. (I'm looking at you <i>Babel</i>) But an evil system is not made of evil parts. It is built on the backs of a thousand small injustices. It's a picture painted in a million shades of dark grey. <br/><br/>In the Handmaid's Tale, there are women who weild the whip, and their are men who die to save them. We are left with hope, and we are left with despair. <br/><br/>This is one of the best books I have read this year, and it will stay with me for a long time. Strongly recommend. <br/><br/>What follows are just some quotes that stuck me while I read it.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Their heads are uncovered and their hair too is exposed, in all its darkness and sexuality. They wear lipstick, red, outlining the damp cavities of their mouths, like scrawls on a washroom wall, of the time before.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>The night mine, my own time, to do with as I will, as long as I am quiet. As long as I don’t move. As long as I lie still. The difference between lie and lay. Lay is always passive. Even men used to say, I’d like to get laid. Though sometimes they said, I’d like to lay her. All this is pure speculation. I don’t really know what men used to say. I had only their words for it.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>I threw the magazine into the flames. It riffled open in the wind of its burning; big flakes of paper came loose, sailed into the air, still on fire, parts of women’s bodies, turning to black ash in the air, before my eyes.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>What could be done? We thought we had such problems. How were we to know we were happy?<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>My nakedness is strange to me already. My body seems outdated. Did I really wear bathing suits, at the beach? I did, without thought, among men, without caring that my legs, my arms, my thighs and back were on display, could be seen. <i>Shameful, immodest.</i> I avoid looking down at my body, not so much because it’s shameful or immodest but because I don’t want to see it. I don’t want to look at something that determines me so completely.<br/></blockquote><br/>Holy shit, that last sentence. Rarely has objectification been so well described.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Dozens of paintings of harems, fat women lolling on divans...being fanned with peacock tails...Studies of sedentary flesh, painted by men who’d never been there. These pictures were supposed to be erotic, and I thought they were, at the time; but I see now what they were really about. They were paintings about suspended animation; about waiting, about objects not in use. They were paintings about boredom.<br/><br/>But maybe boredom is erotic, when women do it, for men.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Better? I say, in a small voice. How can he think this is better?<br/>Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>But people will do anything rather than admit that their lives have no meaning.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>I sit at the little table, eating creamed corn with a fork. I have a fork and a spoon, but never a knife. When there’s meat they cut it up for me ahead of time, as if I’m lacking manual skills or teeth. I have both, however. That’s why I’m not allowed a knife.<br/></blockquote><br/>One should note this this quote is about commiting suicide to escape oppression, and when she says she does have teeth, she means the guts to go through with it.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/> “Nature demands variety, for men. It stands to reason, it’s part of the pro-creational strategy. It’s Nature’s plan.” I don’t say anything, so he goes on. “Women know that instinctively. Why did they buy so many different clothes, in the old days? To trick the men into thinking they were several different women. A new one each day.”<br/></blockquote>",

If this keeps up throughout the series, I will gladly inhale everything this author has ever written. It's hard to put a pin in exactly what I love about the writing....it has a sort of legendary, antique quality, like a story passed down from another age. The descriptions are somehow understated--the writer captures so much of the essence of emotions and scenes without ever belaboring the point with long paragraphs. The emotional and intellectual journey of the main character strikes me as realistic and believable, and Ged is deeply likeable. I love the magic system; it so effortlessly sets up limits on the powers of the characters. The idea that as you travel from areas you are familiar with, your power wanes because you no longer no the name, the essense, of your surroundings.",

      "my_review": "This book is all kinds of wrong for me. For starters, I am almost never a fan of low-stakes fantasy. It's very hard to be interested or engaged when everything is always sure to be hunky dory. This book makes it worse with a kinda childish, story-book tone and a bunch of awkward attempts at character building. It tries to build this cast of cool and quirky pirates and scary villains, but it is overdone in a way that makes them neither cool nor scary. The writing is just kinda bad. I had gotten my hopes up after finishing book 3 of the Daevabad Trilogy (and finding it much improved over the first two in the series) but this book represents a major step backwards in writing.<br/><br/>And then they have the whole breaking the fourth wall thing going on, which I simply didn't love. I think it was trying to be funny or interesting, but I just found it to be a crutch for providing lore exposition. A crutch that unnecessarily pulled me out of the story in the middle of the action at that.<br/><br/>The novel was also riddled with a lot of transparently on-the-nose commentary about social issues. There is the whole rich v poor dynamic with the grandma, the gender identity issues, condemnation of violence, etc. We are reading a book set in the religious, medieval indian ocean world, and the clearly modern commentary and handling of social issues that are delicate even in today's enlightened society was jarring at best. This sort of stuff instantly takes me out of the story.<br/><br/>There is also a kind of weird way that we are expected to believe she is a infamous and awesome pirate, and yet she is also living in an impoverished home, has little social influence, and is morally shocked by minor violence. It's not like she has a reputation for being a morally upstanding pirate. She has a reputation for fucking shit up and being an amazing fighter, etc.<br/><br/>It's also got an exaggerated female version of male-gaze that I think was supposed to be empowering but just kinda came of as insincere/unbelievable. It doesn't feel like a real human female's point of view, it feels like cringy male-gaze with the genders swapped. I read my fair share of female-written romantasy, and this book was the bottom of the barrel in terms of the lameness of its male descriptions. <br/><br/>Maybe in a different mood I would have given this 3 instead of 2, but I didn't really find it average, but rather a notable disappointment.",

      "my_review": "The other two books in this series were plagued by endless annoying issues, constantly pulling me out of the story to roll my eyes. And at the beginning of this book, I had some similar eye rolls for which I will leave my original notes. However, after getting to the halfway point of the book, I realized that it had been a couple hundred pages since my last sigh of exasperation. By the end, I actually managed to really quite enjoy the ending to the series, and I'm glad that I didn't DNF at book 2. It's hard to give an objective rating, maybe 3.5 rounded down instead of up, since I felt like I had to slog through so much to get here, but overall I was pleasantly surprised by book 3. It was exciting and tied up all the plot lines pretty well. <br/><br/><br/>Original Notes:<br/>Seriously? She betrayed her daughter like <i>that</i>?? She met her one, single time, in insane circumstances, and her daughter was confused and betrayed, death all around her, and you expect me to believe that the mother can't understand this?<br/><br/>And as usual, the author has absolutely no concept of money. You're telling me that she has to trade THREE ENTIRE EMERALDS for a cart ride to Cairo? Give me a break. You could have gotten that for free. For one emerald. For asking nicely. These books would be so nice to read if I wasn't rolling my eyes every third second.",

      "my_review": "Lots more promise, lots more infuriating plot and characters, however, the ending somewhat redeemed it. Overall, I'd say I spent less time in this book pissed off, but it's hard to know how much I am being influenced by the Peak-End Rule. As a rule, the author makes an awful habit of contriving events and conflicts to happen because they will be good for the plot, and not because they make sense in the story or from the characters. And so I spent a lot of time furiously rolling my eyes and being yanked out of the story by incredulity. Which really sucks, because the essence of the plot and the various conflicts really could be so immensely interesting.<br/><br/>As I got pissed off during the book, I scratched out some notes. I'll leave them mostly unedited here:<br/><br/><b>Time Jump</b><br/>This started with a 5 year time jump, and I think the author really struggled to conceptualize this. Many character interpersonal interactions read more like a couple months had passed than 5 years. And the intellectual, emotional, and plot progress of the characters also read like only a couple months had passed. As a whole, character relationships with each other hadn't changed or grown in the ways one would expect, character's sense of the world (despair, complacency, love, whatever) hadn't change in the way they should have in 5 years, character skills hadn't grown like they should have, etc, etc, etc. <br/><br/>It was pretty jarring to keep reading how 5 years had supposedly passed, but to then be constantly confronted by identical characters with identical skills, identical emotional problems, and non-existent plot growth. <br/><br/><b>Silly Stuff</b><br/>The book constantly has eye-rolling moments, either with how the plot is contrived or with how the characters act. Here are a couple I bothered to write down.<br/><br/>(after nahiri escapes with zanib) You're telling me she has been locked away for FIVE years, and then the first time she leaves the palace she meets the one highly unlikely group of people that would make the plot more interesting??<br/><br/>(when the prince tries to buy the slaves) He's such a child. He's the fucking prince, and he's going to solve this by buying them? And he's going to use his sword? God I hate him. Also, what is this stupid rift between Muthadir and Ali? It's just so lame and manufactured.<br/><br/>He's so dumb I hate him. TELL HER. Why is he too stupid to tell her that he brought it for her.<br/><br/><b>Paper Father</b><br/>The bad guys often have these paper thin reasons for doing bad things. Mostly they seem to be doing bad things because the plot requires them to be idiots that do bad things, not because it makes any sense.<br/><br/>For instance it would not have been hard at all to verify the courtesan's identity, but instead we get this manufactured conflict. The king is not so stupid that he would threaten the stability of the city over an easily verifiable claim. <br/><br/>Also, the shaffit attack on the parade was so dumb. As if they would attack the one person who healed shaffit and is actively working to improve their conditions. I would buy it if they had attacked another part of the procession.<br/><br/><b>Complete Lack of Empathy</b><br/>There is a recurrent theme of enemies having a mutual friend and then getting into conflict. And always, <i>always</i> the conflict happens anyway despite the mutual friend. It can be an interesting and heart-breaking plot device when it is truly unavoidable, but the author wears it out and uses it in cases where an easy solution seems obvious, making it lose its impact.<br/><br/><b>Interesting Points</b><br/>The plot has some redeeming qualities. For instance the 3-way conflict has a lot of potential. The ancient lore being slowly revealed is really interesting. Especially finding out the past was not what you thought. Although I will have to mention that dhara could seriously just explain himself for once, holy shit. The magic is also pretty cool, though it is definitely plot-driven magic. You have it when the plot needs it, you don't have it when the plot needs you to not have it.<br/><br/>Anyway I think I'm bored of writing about this book. Why is it always the case that I write more about books I took issue with than about books I completely enjoyed? I'll read the next one just to see it through to the end. Thankfully it can be read at 2.2x speed with no trouble.",

      "my_review": "So much promise, such spotty execution. I'm reading this because it comes highly recommended by a friend, but I swear it is pressing every plot and character button I possess. The politics and characters and lore are all interesting, and are the saving grace of this book. However the interaction of plot and character is a nightmare. I'm constantly screaming to myself, \"HOW does that make ANY sense!? why would you DO that???\" It makes for a pretty frustrating read when you often find the character actions utterly stupid and unbelievable. <br/><br/>Here is some stuff that I rage wrote near the beginning of the book. Yes. It was so bad that I had to stop and vent. <br/><br/>Bruh, this book is so badly written and ill-considered, I can't even... The whole premise is that MC is stuck in Cairo and wishes she could get to Istanbul to study healing. She herself blatantly has healing magic -- her wounds heal in seconds and she can heal other people with her thoughts. And yet, listen to this: she doesn't believe in magic. All the magic that happens in the book it <i>shocking</i> to her. And you know how her dream is to go to Istanbul? In the first few pages alone we see her earning jewelry, coins, a gold ring, and the ability to steal from a wealthy man home for 7 days straight. And we are expected to believe that this thieves purse couldn't get her to Istanbul??? Later in the book, we hear such ridiculous comments as: she had never had wine, it was far beyond her means. Yea ok. I'm sure a woman with gold rings couldn't afford a cup of wine.<br/><br/>So I was thinking, whatever, maybe it will just get better. It does not. She consistently makes the most ridiculous decisions, not because she is being portrayed as unintelligent or traumatized, but because the author just can't be bothered to engage in realistic writing. MC is given a magical warrior protector and is being taken to a city of magical beings to be established as the honored princess of a massacred race, and her only thought is to run back to Cairo. I'm maybe two hours into the book, and I'm already itching to write pages of criticism.<br/><br/>Having now finished it, there were many more similar instances of non-sensicalness, such as why is she so weak and useless, why did they have to fight in the infirmary, why is everyone incapable of simple communication, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Hopefully the next book gets better, as this one really does have obvious promise.",

      "my_review": "I first heard this book mentioned in Outlive, and later had it recommended to me by a friend who found it to be very relateable to their own life. It has a good deal of interesting commentary on father/child relationships, the nature of male depression, and how men are brought up as emotional (or non-emotional) beings in modern society. In general I found it to be very well-considered and nuanced. The commentary is interspersed with anonymized stories from his therapy patients. These examples serve to give insight into actual situations experienced by real-world people as well as insight into his own methods for conducting therapy.<br/><br/>So, why three stars? Well, amongst the positives already mentioned, this book just kinda dragged on without seeming to have a strong organization or message. I really missed out on having sections which attempted to consolidate his views on masculinity in society. I also really felt the lack of any instructive guidance given on actions a depressed man can take. Yes, there are scattered examples from therapy sessions, but this is by no means a helpful guidebook, which is both part of what I expected and what it easily could have been. As I grew more and more used to it falling a bit short of my expectations, I grew more and more anxious for it to end. So, it won't really make its way into my core set of recommendations.<br/><br/>But lets step back and see what interesting topics were covered:<br/>- toxic masculinity<br/>- shame vs grandiosity<br/>- illusion of tenderness and sex / mistress as medication<br/>- masculinity, unlike femininity, is conferred. that's why it can be taken away<br/>- performance based esteem<br/><br/>Toxic masculinity: This has gained many variations of definition in the almost three decades since this book was released, however here it refers to cultural norms that perpetuate idealized masculine traits, such as emotional repression, dominance, and stoicism, to the detriment of the individual and society. The author gives many examples of how boys are expected not to cry, to not be momma's boys, and many other small societal nudges that ultimately discourage men from expressing vulnerability, or seeking help. Personally I find myself convinced by the premise that this core difference in male and female upbringings has impacts for emotional well-being in later life. <br/><br/>Illusion of tenderness: The author further posits that many toxic traits he comes across in therapy sessions are simply twisted medication. That a man with a mistress is engaging in the illusion of tenderness. <br/><br/>This is all somewhat tied in with performance-based-esteem. He posits that male esteem is often not fully intrinsic, but is derived totally or partially from personal and societal perceptions of his performance. I think of myself as an emotionally consistent and stable individual, but if I'm introspective, I realize that I absolutely have performance-based-esteem...I've simply been lucky enough to almost always perform well. I feel this explains so much about depression and culture. How losing your job causes depression. How incels go through a downward spiral. How men gravitate to competition, be it in the workplace, video games, chess, etc. Hell, it might even be useful to keep this in mind when considering the wage gap.<br/><br/>He has some interesting things to say about the conference of masculinity, whether it be in tribal rituals, on the football field, or in a stock meeting. I don't know how true it is to say that femininity is not conferred, but I can certainly see how the conference and retraction of masculinity effects myriad aspects of our culture.",

      "my_review": "Solid end to a solid series. It has some flaws here and there, specifically with a melodramatic main character and a tendency to seesaw between absolute victory and absolute defeat, but overall I definitely enjoyed it. I plan to read a few books in the interim and then pick up the rest of the series. Might wait until the 7th comes out in 2025, idk.<br/><br/>Speaking of seesawing, here is something I wrote at the beginning of the ending, which totally had me, hook line and sinker:<br/><br/>\"Cassius gut punched the shit out of me. I did <i>not</i> see it coming. I probably should have, but I didn't. I almost rage/sad quit right then. It was one thing when it was book two, but I'm pretty tired to be this far along and have victory snatched from our grasp by the betrayal of a friend. There is just always all this false build up, just seems to unnecessarily prolong the series. At some point, I want it to end and have resolution. It's just so bipolar, from victory to tragedy. And I just KNEW that the second Sevro got married one of them was gonna die. Such a death flag.\"<br/><br/>I was actually pretty crushed at this \"ending\", and so relieved when it went the other way. I also must say that I really enjoyed Sevro's hanging with Cassius. Such an epic scene, and a cool throwback to the whipping in book one.",

      "my_review": "You know, I'm usually really picky about the technical details making sense in a novel. It bothers me endlessly when all the facts don't line up, and this novel has some obvious silliness going on. Like, why do golds always need to lead the charge and be involved on the ground? Could they really have kept the reds in the dark all these centuries? Why are human soldiers still relevant in this age of space travel? Why would that EMP be set of by a human and not a radio signal? Why won't he just tell the damn girl?<br/><br/>But for some reason, most of these things never manage to bother me as I read. I think it is a combination of three things: <br/>- for most of these it's easy to come up with my own head canon even if the author doesn't directly explain it<br/>- non-sensical elements never really ruin the plot for me<br/>- the book is simply too fast paced for me to dwell too much on anything amiss<br/><br/>In terms of head canon, the EMP thing seems ridiculous. Why would you have a living human set off an EMP when radio, wifi, and bluetooth exist. But then you remember that they spend half the battle talking about jamming signals, and it makes a sort of sense. Why do golds charge into battle? It's ridiculous. But then you can say to yourself that at least among the elite golds, who grow up on stories of battle and conquest and pride and glory, it makes a certain cultural sense. And it's pretty easy to come up with a reasonable explanation like this for most of the problematic areas. <br/><br/>In terms of ruining the plot, the questionable element is rarely something integral, like when there is a massive conflict underpinned by simple communication error, and I'm forced to be stressed out while the characters make obviously ridiculous decisions. Instead it's more like, sure, he won't tell the girl, but their relationship is only a little strained, not destroyed, and there seem to be pretty damn good reasons for not telling her. To take another example, yes, I find it hard to believe that the reds would have never found out the truth after centuries in the dark, but it's also easy to imagine the brutal murders of entire towns if word ever emerged...maybe it's not that unlikely after all.<br/><br/>As for fast paced, I think that speaks for itself. At times, I think that this book might even be a little too fast paced, with the action overwhelming the chance for character development.<br/><br/>On to the actual review...overall, this book was a fast-paced and exciting sequel to Red Rising. I think I may have liked it a little less, but not enough to downgrade the 4 star rating. The ending was marvelous.",

      "my_review": "Surprisingly good. Exciting, interesting characters, good plot. Easy 4 stars.<br/><br/>It took me a little while to really get into it, but it has some really exciting and fun battle scenes by the end. It also had a pretty nice leadership character arc for the MC. <br/><br/>The narrator, Tim Gerard Reynolds, was excellent. Delivered some very powerful lines.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>You do not follow me because I am the strongest. Pax is. <br/>You do not follow me because I am the brightest. Mustang is. <br/>You follow me because you do not know where you are going. I do<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There is one key necessary suspension of disbelief, mainly regarding MC's improbably high intelligence and test performance. I think it is mostly explained away by the test being of lateral thinking and not necessarily of knowledge, but one still wonders why the rest of the golds couldn't get some body and brain mods to do better at the test, and how we ended up with such a brilliant kid being chosen to be plucked out of the slums. I can't say that it bothered me much during the story, mainly because I think we all know how these stories are supposed to go, and it's fun to just go along for the ride with a prodigy. The author also balances it out with failures along the way and the fast pace and engaging writing.",

      "my_review": "Overall, this was a good series. Good plot, interesting magic, strong characters. It has a few minor problems which I have mentioned in the previous reviews -- mainly that it isn't as exciting as many modern works, the characters are sometimes stupider than the reader, and the author often inserts needlessly clumsy reminders of past details. For all that though, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Here are a few jottings I made throughout when things annoyed me.<br/><br/>Hear the beginning, I found myself getting pretty annoyed here and there with Fitz's refusal to allow any kind of help and his insistence on keeping secrets, but at least it tracks with his history of dumb decisions.<br/><br/>As the end approached I was repeatedly aghast that they couldn't figure out obvious plot points, such as needing to wit to the elderlings, which, if it wasn't obvious enough from the fools prophesies, was <i>painfully</i> obvious as soon as they found the elderlings. The author really wanted me to stretch my imagination at the end to believe the characters so stupid as to not realize the \"statues\" were the elderlings, and the wit was the secret to waking them.<br/><br/>And then the fool suddenly asking about Molly could not be more suspicious. This is one of the few times I felt that Hobb let the desire for a certain plot muddle the actual expected actions of the characters. There is no way this sudden questioning could have gone unnoticed, as it was clearly telegraphed to the reader the moment it was done. <br/><br/>And to compound on all this the silly refusal of the party to understand Verity's actions...there at the end the author really leaned into how utterly blind all the characters were in order to have the plot work out in a certain way.<br/><br/>And of course I disagree strongly with Fitz's silly refusal to be acknowledged. It's hard for me to say whether I think it is bad character writing or I just disagree with the choice, maybe more of the latter.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's like every new female character immediately wants to get into bed with Fitz. I wouldn't say this series has male gaze, and as we all know this series was written by a woman, but somehow it still sticks out like a sore thumb. I think it is partially how the author handles it. Sure, I know that even in the real world, there are some men who are effortlessly attractive and have a disproportionate amount of partners. But they don't attract <i>every</i> woman. <br/><br/>I probably wouldn't hesitate too much to recommend this series to a fantasy fan, however it would come with the caveat that it reads like an older series and has a slow burn and shouldn't be expected to be fast page turner.",

      "my_review": "For starters, I hate these intros where he is an old man and he tells you things about the overall plot. What is this weird desire to spoil things for me??  <br/><br/>Secondly, I hate, HATE this ridiculous romantic conflict arising from miscommunication trope. It's almost enough to make me put the book down.<br/><br/>It's also pretty annoying dealing with the intellectual incompetence of the characters.<br/>- fool clearly saying the wit is how to contact the dragons<br/>- queen having the wit<br/>- bastard fighting the white magician with the wit, and no one understanding<br/>- the forged not being detectable by the wit<br/><br/>And by god, could it be more obvious that Molly is pregnant? Just exactly how stupid is our main character??<br/><br/>It also seems pretty off to me how little is made of Fitz's battle prowess. By all accounts he should be loved and respected by his fighting peers, and his reputation should spread throughout the keep. Yet somehow the author never makes anything of this. I don't think I've ever seen the bond of fighting men treated so casually in all of literature.  <br/><br/>Sometimes it just gets a little too ridiculous how none of the common folk can see Royal's constant betrayals. How he abandoned the queen to die but no one mentions it. How he abandoned the raided town but everyone acts like it was he who sent out the message, despite many witnesses. And on and on. I don't mind having his conniving manipulation of the rumor mill be a plot point, but sometimes its effects are exaggerated further than I can believe.<br/><br/>How in the fuck do all these morons maintain this incredible ignorance?<br/><br/>The writer has this extraordinarily clumsy way of pointedly reminding you of who characters are and what happened a couple of chapters ago. She'll bring up a character we haven't seen in a while and proceed to give a little book report on them as if we had not a single neuron in our brains to remember anything. Truly, I often struggle when a book has too many characters to remember who is who, and I can certainly appreciate a gentle reminder here and there, but by god this writer goes overboard with it to an almost insulting degree.<br/><br/>For all this though, the book has an interesting an unique plot with a wonderful magic system. The characters are strong and 3 dimensional, and even if the book doesn't exactly turn pages, you still can't help but plow on. <br/><br/>I think this second installment impressed me more than the first, but I still struggle to give it a full 4 stars. 3.5 rounded down, as I still don't know that this would be my strongest recommendation.",

      "my_review": "A fun and enjoyable read. This book sort of has an old, dated feel, especially in the pacing and the action. It is certainly slower and less of a page turner than its modern fantasy contemporaries. However after suffering through the endlessly ill-considered plot and characters of Rothfuss, this book is a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>It has interesting and distinct characters whose actions make sense, and a plot that is driven by logic rather than the random whims of the author. Had this book been a bit more exciting, I would have given it 4 stars, but as it is, I'll give it 3.5 rounded down to 4, since I although I would mention it as interesting fantasy, it's not something I'm itching to recommend.",

      "my_review": "In general, this is similar to the first book; a self-indulgent male fantasy with weak characters and a plot that is more concerned with aligning to the author's grand plan than in actually making sense. It must be admitted that it is fun to read, but its flaws in plot and character writing are overwhelming.<br/><br/>I don't know if I have the desire to fully enumerate all of its shortcomings, and this review will be rather low effort, but I'll list a few things as they come to me. <br/><br/>God, the section with the malfeasance was so dumb. 1) the writing. it's just so convenient that MC supposedly can't go to the masters about it. The author is always setting up too-convenient sequences like this. But even setting up this supposed rationale, the whole sequence was miserably considered. First, lets say that I buy that he can't go officially to the masters. What is to stop him from going to a single master he trusts? At this point the author is just looking for reasons to have him do illegal things. And then there is how he makes constantly unintelligent decisions. Why the hell would he go to buy the plans instead of just going to the library first. And in what INSANE world would he think that making a doll of her would be a good idea. And all the secrets he keeps for no reason from his friends. The whole thing is just badly written and makes no sense.<br/><br/>The romance scenes. So gross, so much cringe virtue signaling. From the disease section to the 'not all men' section, it just never stops. It's like reading a shitty harem anime. And what romance scenes that aren't cringe aren't even spicy, they are just boring and self-masturbatory. You could write pages on what's wrong with the 'romance' in this novel.<br/><br/>I mentioned this in the review for book one, but Rothfuss is constantly shoehorning the story into his grand vision for the plot. It's like he wrote an outline that said: MC needs to be poor, really poor, and did I mention destitute. But then when he starts actually writing, the story and the characters and simple logic make it clear that he should be able to casually make money, so the author is forced to either ignore logic or to make up silly plot happenings to ensure that we have a shitty explanation for why MC remains destitute. Like when he saved the mayor's life, got him a brand new wife, eliminated the bandits, AND took care of a murdering and raping troop, and the mayor tells him he is hopelessly in debt to him, and yet MC still manages to barely capitalize on this. Whether it is from MC's unexplained sudden inaptitude or a contrived hatred for the Ruh, he manages to never get any decent reward. <br/><br/>I don't know. It's honestly a bit hard to understand how TWMF gets such glowing reviews, considering its flaws. This book is so well-liked that I'm tempted to put more effort into seriously criticizing it, but I kinda just want to move on with my life.",

      "my_review": "I was very lulled into the first half of the book. I've always been a sucker for living vicariously through the life of a prodigy, especially magical ones. For some reason it's just great fun to watch a young student kick ass. So I found a lot to like in the first section of the book, with the broodingly powerful innkeeper, the traveling troop, and the hijinks at school. <br/><br/>However, there are some constant flaws that underly the writing, specifically with consistent portrayal of character decision making. We are presented with this MC who is an undisputed prodigy in every possible field he tries his hand at. He is wickedly intelligent, creative, picks up languages and mental techniques fast, is a beautiful singer and musician, can hold a conversation with the best of them, and is even easy on the eyes. <br/><br/>And yet somehow, after 6 months or so of mourning in the forest, when he enters the city, he somehow manages to be a useless twat for three entire years. At no point does he juggle for money, tell stories, sing, use magic, or even use his intelligence in any way. He just lives in abject miserable poverty with barely a hint of explanation from the author as to why the reader is suddenly expected to completely ignore the MC's immense innate talent, his prodigal existing skills, his ridiculous ability to pick up new techniques, and his already vast knowledge on seemingly every subject, from math to medicine<br/><br/>Oh sure, there's a hand wave here and there about traumatic memories, but this in no way explains his miserable state as a starving, helpless street urchin.<br/><br/>The school section seemed to finally get us back on track, but then the story started to fall apart for me again during the journey to explore the blue fire. All the conversations seemed lame and stilted, and the plot was silly. This author really seems to gravitate towards this plot device of accidental or malicious drugging, and it's always weakly implemented.<br/><br/>It is also worth mentioning that the writing of female characters is very weak, despite some rather off-putting virtue signaling by the author about consent and violence. Every female character is either beautiful or mysterious or incredibly talented. In short, every female character manages to be the object of one male fantasy or another. <br/><br/>I certainly don't mind reading about smart and beautiful women, but there is a difference between beautiful women as people and beautiful women as plot devices. As a quick tally, we have the gorgeous library girl who exists to be gorgeous and saved in the fire. Then we have the cute but crazy rooftop girl, who exists to be cared for like a stray cat. Then we have stunning but flighty Dana, who exists to be tragically unobtainable...and on and on. <br/><br/>Then there is the weird virtue signaling. I must mention here that the virtues being signaled are obviously commendable, however the awkward signaling of them was just...weird. Like we have that one scene where Dana has been drugged and is crying and telling MC how she knows he would never beat her, even if he had to. And instead of the writing feeling like an honest exploration of violence it was instead somehow cheap and pandering. I should also note that at the time of writing, I'm halfway done with the second book, and there is a similar weird scene when MC has the anti-inhibition drug. <br/><br/>Anyway, this book had a lot of promise, and had a significant head start by being from a genre I am almost guaranteed to enjoy. But it was consistently held back by weak character writing and contrived plots. Obviously I liked it enough to read the second one, but it won't be at the top of my fantasy recommendation list.",

      "my_review": "Not great, but a solidly entertaining book. I was reading some dry non-fiction and needed a break and picked this one up. It's cringey and predictable, but in a way that makes you look forward to the next scene instead of wanting to put it down. <br/><br/>The writer definitely struggles to show and not tell -- you can especially see this with characters like Astrid, who are written to be amazing and perfect and incredible and awesome and wonderful but are mostly shown being materialistic and weak. <br/><br/>I think a big part of the enjoyment is vicariously living these wild lives through the story -- the idea of buying the hotel where the manager snubs you, or casually taking a private jet to a private island of debauchery. <br/><br/>I do think it was pretty interesting that even the best of the characters were still incredibly shallow and materialistic at times, like Astrid with her $200,000 dresses and Araminta with her island shopping spree and awful friends. I think we are meant to like both of these characters or at least sympathize with them, but they are nonetheless often shown in a decidedly mixed light. <br/><br/>I could definitely have done with some more resolution on the ending, but I guess that is what the rest of the series is for. I won't read the next books immediately, but I wouldn't mind picking them up if I wanted a light read.",

      "my_review": "For a romance novel, the action and the plot were actually pretty enjoyable and fun. Although I definitely spent the first half <i>hating</i> the fmc mmc conflict. Like, ugh. Why does book two of every romance series have to be frenemies. I'm so bored of it; just make up your mind. Once our main characters finally reconciled it was such a relief. I will admit that the author provided very convincing reasons for the conflict, so at no point did I feel like it was manufactured.<br/><br/>The romance in this series is notable and somewhat trauma oriented. The author's emphasis on constant, vocal consent is noticeable in the first book, but by the second book it is almost fetishized. And consent is not just a romantic thing. For instance in the first book, you see it in a lot of little scenes, like how fmc will shy away from any vampires, and subsequently it is presented as a big deal when mmc allows her to have physical space. There is also that one blood drinking scene in the first book with the knife and mmc being so careful to make sure fmc is \"in control\".<br/><br/>By the second book, it's kind of a constant background note in all romantic scenes, and a non-trivial part of the romantic development is fmc feeling more and more comfortable with mmc. There's one scene in particular where the mmc makes a huge deal about getting consent for missionary, since unlike when fmc is on top, in missionary she would be \"trapped\", and fmc has an internal monologue talking about how surprising it is to feel safe with him, etc. <br/><br/>Mmc has been through intense trauma for 70 straight years, and fmc had a traumatic first experience, and had grown up as a weak human in a world of vampires, which is presented as its own trauma. These themes of trauma and how they affect the platonic and romantic relationship are frequently explored. <br/><br/>The romantic scenes themselves are pretty well-written, better than A Fate Inked in Blood, I think. Although I will say that this author does not hold back on the whole vampire thing. She manages to make blood sucking a very sensual part of the romantic scenes. <br/><br/>Anyway, there were a few plot points that bothered me. Septimus was presented as extremely calculating, and based on the socio-politic landscape the author showed us, I saw no real reason for him to betray the main characters. It made for an interesting plot, but didn't make much sense. Additionally, the power scaling sometimes seemed off. Vincent razed whole cities with his power, but sometimes our main characters, even with their combined strength, will struggle against far lesser enemies.  We are simultaneously shown terrifying power and unexplained inadequacies, depending on what the plot requires. <br/><br/>Finally, the coreatus bond was not perfectly justified. Clearly the vampire god can casually bring people back to life, based on the ending to the first book. So in the second book, bringing mmc back to life would be a trivial thing. She wouldn't have needed to ruin the bloodlines with a heart bond to do it. But for plot reasons, we needed this special bond. It was fun to have it end that way, but it didn't make logical sense.<br/><br/>I also had some problems with the pacing. This whole series kinda seems like big battle, almost die, miraculous recovery, BIG BATTLE, ALMOST DIE, MIRACULOUS RECOVERY, again and again and again. They kinda stop being exciting when they happen so often and everyone always miraculously recovers no matter what. <br/><br/>To sum up, if you are willing to slog though the frenemies bit, and a plot complaint here and there, this is a fun continuation to the first book in the series.",

      "my_review": "Another beautifully written work by Dickens, this is not the sort of thing you can listen to at 1.7x speed. I managed to get this one narrated by Anton Lesser, who was excellent, as always. <br/><br/>Even more so than Great Expectations, this book is absolutely packed with quick historical references. I had a good time on this site afterwards, learning about some of the references in the first couple chapters. https://dickens.stanford.edu/tale/print_issue1_gloss.html<br/><br/>It is hard to say whether I simply wasn't in the mood, or if the book really was worse, but I certainly enjoyed myself less in this novel than in Great Expectations. It is true that it moves at a faster pace, covers an interesting subject matter, and has an engaging plot. However, as with Great Expectations, I often found all the character connections to be rather contrived, and some key elements to be rather predictable. <br/><br/>Overall I think this is a 3.5 on enjoyment rounded up to a 4 by virtue of the writing and the fact that I probably would recommend it to someone wanting to read some 1800s works.",

      "my_review": "There is a lot of non-sensical stuff in this book. Why was the escaped thrall abandoned on the beach and then saved? Why do the blood sworn need to kill the jarl instead of talking? Why doesn't that bear thing they captured turn into a bear first in order to fight them instead of being captured? Why does the psychopath thrall have to kill the dad? <br/><br/>Sure, the setting and mythology are cool, but so much of this book reeks of manufactured action, and not of well-considered plot. The violence just makes no sense. <br/><br/>The characters do not act like real people, with motivations and strategies and a healthy concern for their own lives. Instead they fight and kill and die for no reason. Individuals jump into fights with impossible odds. War bands enter large battles with no planning or strategy. The violence isn't realistic, it is simply used by the author to make the book seem exciting and drive the endless revenge plots.<br/><br/>Speaking of plots, holy lameness. Depending on how you count, there are 3-6 main characters in the book, and FIVE of them are driven by a one revenge plot or another. Is this author incapable of writing anything unique or interesting??<br/><br/>Ugh, I'm tired of writing this review. This book sucked and I googled the rest of the series. Hard pass.",

      "my_review": "Ok, hear me out. Yes I know, it's full of cliches, and sometimes the plot can be a little silly. Like, what are the chances that her only friend in the world just happens to get teleported in and brutally murdered right in front of her? But the book is just so fun. <br/><br/>All the characters feel far more adult than the usual romance fare. It was nice not to have to slog through a bunch of whining and second guessing and pointless miscommunication. I also found the MMC FMC dynamic to be somewhat fresh. I mean, yes, he was tall, dark, and quietly dangerous, as always, but unlike the moody, frowning buckets of darkness that we usually get, he had a constant, playful positivity in his interactions. <br/><br/>The whole, I-murder-a-vampire-every-night plotline wasn't the most believable thing in the world, but at least it actually gave some credibility to our FMC's battle prowess. <br/><br/>I should probably clarify my 4 star rating by saying that this is not a book I would recommend to just anyone, but if you are in the market for a fun romance read with some definite spice, there are definitely worse options.",

      "my_review": "Perhaps one star is a little harsh, however I had high expectations for this book of which I was rudely disabused. I own several books geared towards beginners that reference shading here and there, and I expected this to be a book-length treatment of the critical sub-topic of shading. It was not. I expected to learn advanced and interesting shading techniques. I did not.<br/><br/>This book was a weird mix of far too basic and extremely complicated with no explanation. The horribly explained contouring section comes to mind. Additionally, it was text heavy with very few exercises or unique examples. Most of the content of the book is shown on the front cover. I don't necessarily mind a text heavy art book so long as the text is insightful and supports sufficient examples. 'Human Anatomy for Artists' by Eliot Goldfinger is a good example -- volumes of useful text explanation coupled with hundreds of brilliant illustrations. Unfortunately this book was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>As another reviewer mentioned, significant space was dedicated to milquetoast QA between the author and students that was usually unhelpful and often contained useless, self-congratulatory praise for the instructor's lesson. It seemed like a poor attempt at copying the style of Mark Kistler in his superior 'You Can Draw in 30 Days'.<br/><br/>I read this book in Kindle Format, however my review is of the contents of the book. I did not remove any stars for how pathetically the Kindle version was rendered. If for some reason you still wish to buy this book after reading my review, I would recommend purchasing a physical copy.",

      "my_review": "This is an absolutely gorgeous reproduction of the 1888 Le Costume Historique. It was originally published in 6 leatherbound volumes spanning a combined 3224 pages with over 500 plates, and a complete copy can set you back a couple grand. There are some excellent scans of the original work in the French here https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/costume-historique. <br/><br/>This reproduction is <i>massive</i>, with images 3 to 4 times bigger than in the original copy, and it is wonderful to look at. As it comes in at less than 700 pages, much attention has been placed on reproducing the plates, at the cost of sacrificing a huge amount of the original text. What space that is given to the text is done so in usual Tachen form, it English, German, and French, further reducing the available real estate. <br/><br/>I find the work rather suffers from this choice, as there are countless instances where I have been flipping through the plates, found a particularly interesting numbered figure, gone to read the description, only to find that it has been excluded for brevity.<br/><br/>The publishers themselves mention this lack, and I understand its reasons, but it is unfortunate. Truth be told, if they sold this in a version twice as long but twice as expensive, I probably would not have bought it.<br/><br/>However, there is one missing element that I find inexcusable, and which is the primary reason I could never countenance giving this Tachen edition 5 stars. The book completely lacks any reasonable table of contents or index. If you come to this masterpiece hoping to look up a particular country or time period, you will be sorely disappointed. Although the book is loosely organized by historical period, and segmented within by the region under discussion, actually finding the region you are interested in is nigh impossible. I have spent ages flipping through the pages looking for a plate I had lost or a time period I wanted to explore without success.<br/><br/>If you have an interest in clothing, art, world culture, or in late 1800s books, then this is an easy recommendation.<br/>",

      "my_review": "My first introduction to Dickens, this was a truly lovely novel. I listened to the Anton Lesser narration, and he did a wonderful job, nailing the various accents and manners of speech.<br/><br/>The writing is lovely, and the plot is fun and engaging, with lots of nice twists, even if they are sometimes predictable. The characters are quite interesting at times; Dickens felt no need to have the main character always be likeable. <br/><br/>It's perhaps a little cliche by modern standards, or perhaps I mean to say that the plot is at times contrived, but I still think that it holds up very well.<br/><br/>He's got some lovely turns of phrase:<br/><br/><blockquote> The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr. Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going.</blockquote><br/><br/>There are also many instances where you have to really pay attention to catch references which would probably have been much more transparent at the time or writing. I shudder to think of how many I must have missed entirely.<br/><br/><blockquote> There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.</blockquote><br/><br/>Loops here, is of course in reference to the hangman's noose.<br/><br/>By the time of writing this review, I am almost done with Tale of Two Cities, and I think that Great Expectation is a gentler introduction to Dickens.<br/>",

      "my_review": "This is a hard rating for me, and sometime in the future I might turn this jumble of thoughts into a real review. I liked the book, especially Hemmingway's sad endings. And I liked the deep subject matter and the philosophical and political musings.<br/><br/>However I often felt the characters and the dialog to be forced, and I found the philosophy to be rather on the nose. I also found commentary on Pilar's descriptions to be self congratulatory.<br/><br/>Regarding the writing style, I preferred it to A Farewell to Arms, but didn't love the 'direct' spanish translations. The way 'thee' and 'thou' were used and molested instead of bothered, ect. I speak enough Spanish to get what he was going for, but I can't really fathom why. Robert Jordan was meant to be a professor of Spanish, with only a bit of an accent noticeable to a native speaker. So he would not have made these sorts of clumsy translations. And I find they harm the reading experience.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is completely unclear to me what the pattern of usage for thee and thou was. Whenever I paid close attention, it neither lined up with usted and tu, nor with plural and singular, so I struggle to understand his intent.<br/><br/>A real shame to about all the 'I obscenity in the milk of thy mother's'. What a stupid world that censorship keeps authors from writing what they'd really like. <br/><br/>Anyway, I have some temptations to give this a 4, but the book really was a mixed bag for me, so it'll get a 3 for now. I read the Campbell Scott naration, and it was in a rather lovely, mid atlantic accent.",

      "my_review": "I loved The Old Man and the Sea, but was initially very disappointed with A Farewell to Arms. The terse style that did so well in the mostly two character book struggled to convey the same emotions for me in the character and dialog dense Farewell to Arms.<br/><br/>From a historical sense, I loved reading all the dated references. The constant drinking, even while pregnant to 'keep the baby small'. Walking everywhere and not knowing where people were. Food not being available past lunch time. The attitudes towards marriage and the baby. It strikes me that fantasy writers really should read more written during the 1800 and early 1900s, as I rarely see these types of elements mentioned. <br/><br/>There were times while reading this book that I was sure I would give it two stars. It wasn't average, I felt, it was actively failing to meet expectations. But having finished it, and thinking over it, my opinion seems to grow and grow. I find myself fondly remembering the way I felt, living the lives with the characters. <br/><br/>And the ending. Holy shit what an incredible ending. If there is anything to say for Hemingway, he nails the feeling of deep loss, without ever needing to over sell it. <br/><br/>I think this may have been a 4 star read under different circumstances, maybe I'll revisit my rating if I end up recommending it to a lot of people, but for now I'll give it a 3.5 rounded down to a 3.",

      "my_review": "Pretty wild to read this after plowing through all of the Stormlight archive. The difference in pace cannot be understated. <br/><br/>I had a few minor problems with it here and there, such as Vasher being overwhelmed a bit too easily in fights every now and then, but overall this is a really solid addition to the cosmere. I think this would be a perfectly good entrypoint to Sanderson's writing, and is of course worth reading before book 2 of the stormlight archive. <br/><br/>Though the first princess definitely took some time to grow on me, I enjoyed both of their stories and thought it had a nice, engaging plot.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. I don't totally know how to feel about the two deaths in the book. They both took me by surprise, which is excellent, and I'm tempted to find them very moving, but I can also see that they were somewhat manufactured for maximum emotional impact by the author, as opposed to feeling like a natural part of the plot. <br/><br/>At the end of the day though, this was a fun book with an interesting magic system and premise, and would be an easy recommendation for a quick fantasy read.<br/><br/>Apparently it is hard to get ahold of, but I listened to the Michael Kramer narration, which was excellent.",

It's broken into 4 parts that focus on a handful of main characters. However at the interludes, he'll give quick glimpses into minor characters that provide context to the overall narrative. The pacing is also really interesting. It will often be a normal sort of chapter per character, but when the action gets intense he will often jump almost frantically between viewpoints, in a way that really contributes to the storytelling. <br/><br/>The final battle was really well-done and exciting, and overall there were some really great scenes. Definitely looking forward to the next couple books.",

I was shouting with excitement during some of the better scenes. The politics are fun, the action is great, the budding romance is tantalizing, the writing style is fluid, and the multi-pov/flashback structure is engaging.<br/><br/>I will absolutely be reading the rest of the series, and regretting that the fifth book has not yet been released.",

      "my_review": "Excellent. This is entertaining epic fantasy with action, intrigue, and captivating stories.  <br/><br/>It's narrated by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. Kramer is ok, but not great: his inadequacies really show during action scenes. Kate Reading is horrible. I almost DNF'd when I realized she would be reading significant parts of this 45 hour book. Her normal speech pattern has this unnatural rise in tone at the end of every couple words, and it grates painfully on the ears, making it hard to focus on the story. Meanwhile, her accents for fictional foreign characters are the worst I have ever heard, out of approximately 200 audiobooks.<br/><br/>Narration aside, this is a very enjoyable book with interesting and novel fantasy concepts that satisfies in its own right and promises an epic story to come.",

      "my_review": "Positively lovely. This is an easy 5 star coffee table book. The attention to detail is extreme and the art is delightful.<br/><br/>It contains 50 or so paintings of Tokyo store fronts, typically in a two page spread. One page gets the full storefront painting and the opposite page gets 4 detail insets with fun facts, descriptions, and artist commentary, written in both Japanese and English. Every 10 stores, there is a dedicated 2 page spread that summarizes the last 10 stores and gives some more facts, dates, and addresses. Starting the next section you get an artistic map of where the next stores will be. And at the end of the book there is an illustrated section with the artistic tools and supplies the author uses.<br/><br/>The book itself is great. It's a soft cover with a book jacket, and the publisher added some fun details. The book jacket shows a completed painting of a storefront, but if you take it off, the physical cover shows the same storefront in the original pencil sketch with perspective markings. The inside of the cover has a map of tokyo with all the stores drawn on their location as cute tiny versions of themselves. <br/><br/>It's a great book to flip through, and a great book to sit down and read. Each of the storefronts is interesting and unique, and this is one of my nicer coffee table books.",

This book has excellent reviews, so an hour in I was rather surprised, at 3 hours I was becoming deeply worried, and by the 5th hour I could no longer stand the weirdly fake and stilted interpersonal interactions. This author writes about human emotions as if she's a newly sentient slime mold whose only knowledge of humanity comes from binge watching jersey shore. <br/><br/>I'm tempted to give a bunch of examples of characters completely altering their emotions and behaviors simply because the plot demanded it, or quoting some of the robotic dialog interspersed between unrealistic plot points, but I honestly don't want to spend anymore time thinking about this miserable excuse for a book. <br/><br/>The top negative review for this book was from Kat Kennedy, and man do I wish I had read it before starting, \"...so I can go back to imagining a world where authors like this are forcibly chained to their desks and made to read their own stories over and over again until they’re sorry.\"",

Additionally, it has both english and hiragana, which is very helpful. So, why 3 stars? Well, it's a board book with literally 10 pages and two tiny sentences per page. Near the end you get some mildly complicated stuff, like　黒い猫は白い猫の上にいます。but mostly it's just at the level of 犬は外にいます。So basically you are paying for 20 short sentences with pictures. It also loses points for having no kanji, which would have been great since a reader of genki would have known most of them.",

      "my_review": "This was fun. The magic system was interesting and the action was surprisingly good. Plot was pretty entertaining too, even if I couldn't stand the main character sometimes, especially near the end. Seriously her reaction during the ending was the worst.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ahead. It's been obvious since page 5 that Bjorn hates his dad, and obvious to everyone except Freya, apparently, that he was the \"traitor\". And yet for some ridiculous reason she freaks the hell out at the end, refusing to listen, let him explain, or realize the blatantly obvious. And then right when I thought she would have had a chance to get past the initial shock and have an adult conversation, SHE JUMPS OFF THE FREAKING BOAT. ugh.<br/><br/>Anyway, although the flirting was pretty corny at times, I did think some of the earlier frostbite intimate scenes were better than Fourth Wing, which is currently my only other romantasy to compare with. The build up was definitely not as good though.<br/><br/>Overall a fun and quick read, although not quite good enough that I'm itching to recommend it to anyone. I'll definitely read the next book when it comes out.",

      "my_review": "Have you ever wanted to read a story about Runescape written by a porn-addicted 13 year old boy? Then holy shit have you found the right book. The writing is on a 3rd grade level, the erotica is <i>terrible</i>, and the \"humor\" doesn't even deserve the name. <br/><br/>The premise sounded so promising; a dungeon chest monster that eats unwary adventurers slowly starts leveling up and accidently becomes super powerful. The reader would get to watch as shapeshifting chest got more intelligent and learned to exploit the world in unique ways. Based on the cover art and subtitle, obviously we were going to have to put up with some fanservice, but this book has crazy high ratings on amazon and goodreads, so it's probably going to be funny and interesting?<br/><br/>No. Absolutely not. It was miserable. The female characters were clearly written by a 31 yr-old incel licking doritos off his fingers while his mom screamed down into the basement that his hot pockets were ready. And the cool level-up story line was borderline boring. I mean yea, I did finish the book to find out how it would end, but holy shit was it a chore. If you are the kind of person who enjoyed <i>I'm a Spider So What?</i> or <i>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</i> and you think I am just being harsh because I didn't know what to expect from the genre...no. I enjoyed both of those shows, despite their flaws, and by comparison this book has almost no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. <br/><br/>Like, I don't need a 10 page tutorial on how hp works. And when that tutorial is over, I don't want to read a poorly executed plot full of weak characters, rampant sexism, and flat humor. If you want to get into litrpg, try <i>Dungeon Crawler Carl</i> instead.",

      "my_review": "After reading <i>The Tainted Cup</i>, I was very excited to read more by Bennett, but lord preserve me, this book was mediocre. The dialogue was stilted and silly, the characters didn't resonate as real people, and the narration by Alma Cuervo was abysmal. It's as if Recorded Books grabbed a random lady from the Target checkout line, handed her a book and a mic, and wished her the best. Her voice acting had the fake intonation of a middle school play, and it often didn't even bother to be appropriate to the lines being read. Her ability to perform different voices is nonexistent, and the editors managed to leave in the sounds of every cough and page turn. <br/><br/>Although the world building was often unique and interesting, the themes the author explored quickly wore thin. The characters were constantly struggling to understand \"deep\" philosophies that I had grown tired of hearing of 100 pages earlier. And someone should tell Bennett that plot twists don't deserve the name if they've been obvious for a dozen chapters. Even the political machinations and character behaviors were often weird and unrealistic to the point of yanking me out of the story to shake my head in disbelief.<br/><br/>Looking at the publication dates, this book was written ~10 years before the first one I read and liked, and it certainly reads like a young author's early attempt at writing. Supposedly the second book in the series gets better, so maybe I'll pick that one up at some point. Anyway, this had enough problems to be a 2.5 rounded down to 2, since it definitely doesn't deserve a spot with some of my recent 3s.",

      "my_review": "So. Good. This is not some romping adventure. It is a book about loneliness. About womanhood, and motherhood, and longing. About living in last place, but struggling to live anyway. About walking through an unfair, uncaring world and seeking out the meaning in it all. It's about the happiness that you can find in life, if only you look for it, and the painful joy of being mortal.<br/><br/>Circe is a minor goddess, born just short of beautiful and just short of brilliant. Her tale is of being shunned by the gods and abused by mankind, but also about the isolated islands of fulfilment she finds along the way. The story and the characters held me, and the ending was perfect. It's an easy 5 stars and a strong recommendation.<br/><br/>Quite a few powerful quotes in the book, these two on traditional perceptions of womanhood.<br/><blockquote><br/>Humbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be no story unless we crawl and weep.<br/><br/>it is a common saying that women are delicate creatures. Flowers, eggs...anything that may be crushed in a moment's carelessness. If i had ever believed it, I no longer did.<br/></blockquote><br/>This next one is little lost out of context, but basically Circe's companion is finally going to the island, however Circe is longing for company, for true companionship, and she can only pretend to be happy about this and everyone knows it. Some authors would spell this out. But Madeline doesn't bury our faces in this sadness, rather she lets it wash over us with the the unspeaking sorrow of things unsaid. She does this often throughout the book, and I treasured the author's willingness to let emotions rest, writhing under the surface of quiet words. <br/><blockquote><br/>I spoke briskly. \"You should take the boat of course. It's charmed against sea-disaster ... it will let you leave as soon as you are ready.\"<br/>He was silent for so long, I thought he had not heard. <br/>Then he said, \"that is a kind offer, thank you...Then you will have your island back.\" <br/>I heard the crackles in the brush. I heard the sea distant on the shore. The sound of our breaths vanishing into its ceaseless wash. <br/>\"Yes\", I said. \"I will.\"<br/></blockquote>",

This is the sort of book you pick up for a quick and fun read, and I wouldn't mind reading another from this author.",

However, the excitement is a little gone for me. Maybe it's because I made the mistake of binging 6 in a row, or maybe the quality really is a little less. To be fair, I have really been enjoying the larger storylines play out. And there were definitely some sad parts and some very exciting parts as well. I guess this is really a 3.5 from me, but it doesn't feel quite right to lump it in with the other 4 stars on my list, so I'm giving it a 3.",

      "my_review": "When I saw the cover, I was immediately worried. Sure, it has insanely high ratings on goodreads and amazon...but so did <i>Legends and Lattes</i>, and that book was terrible. And the premise is so easy to mess up: you could make it too cheesy, spend too much time on mechanics, have too many easy outs for characters or bad power balancing. Turns out, I was worried for nothing.<br/><br/>This book is everything I could want in a light-hearted lit-RPG. It's got the humor of Portal and the absurdity of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, all wrapped up in a nostalgic RPG setting. It was funny, fast-paced, engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. <br/><br/>Reading it is very much like playing a video game, and I expected the author to struggle with pacing and implementation details.  However, by the time of writing this review, I have already read 5 of the 6 books in the series, and although there have been a couple slow spots here and there, overall the series is a real page turner. <br/><br/>The author is slowly building a complicated world both inside and outside the dungeon, and I'm very excited to see how all the pieces will come together. <br/><br/>Also, the narrator is <i>amazing</i>. This is one of the few books where I am confident I prefer to listen, as the narrator Jeff Hayes adds so much to the experience.",

      "my_review": "It's tempting to view history through the lens of linear progress, with America as the stalwart bastion of liberty, shining her bright light for all to see. I mean, maybe we had slaves for a little while, but we totally freed them in the civil war, and after that we were one big happy melting pot. Right?<br/><br/>Sure, everyone in school is taught that the south was racist, Andrew Jackson was mean to the Indians, and maybe even that we had Japanese internment camps in WWII. Maaaybe there is even a lesson on the Pinkertons. But these things have a feeling of being contained, and, well, ancient history. But Hochschild takes the reader on an awful ride through a time period where you could be hated just as much for being the wrong kind of white as you could be for being black. Where the US Postal system actively shut down newspapers it didn't like and engaged in a wide-spread censorship campaign to suppress free speech. Where blacks trying to make a living after moving North to the safety of Illinois were nailed in boxes and burned alive. Where you could be fired just for taking driving classes from a dirty German. Where making a film about the American revolution, which showed the Brits in a negative light, would land you in jail for 10 years and with the modern equivalent of a $90,000 fine. <br/><br/>Hochschild shows us a world where pastors had their churches burned to the ground for giving sermons on the wrong subject in the wrong language. Where labor organizers were jailed en mass, on false charges, with local, state, and even federal government officials complicit in the intrigue. Where United States senators could be characterized as being, 'ardent defenders of lynching', and a constant worry in the hearts of many Americans was that blacks would get too uppity after serving in the military. After all, first the black man gets his expectations up after meeting French women, and then \"it is but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected\" (actual quote from a pro-lynching Senator). Women, who still couldn't vote, were also getting dangerous ideas. This was a world where among the many terrors of Bolshevism was the horrifying prospect of women divorcing their husbands and having freedom and autonomy. <br/><br/>God help you if you were pro-labor and anti-war. Frank Little, a white man who held both of these dangerous positions in Montana, was dragged alive behind a car before being lynched. Surviving evidence indicates involvement by the local mining company and the local police's chief detective. After the murder, the Vice President of the United States quipped that, in solving labor problems, \"A Little hanging goes a long way.\" <br/><br/>If you had rewritten this book so it seemed that all these things were taking place in some foreign dictatorship, I would have shaken my head sadly at those sad souls living sad lives in their sad country, then saluted the nearest bald eagle before reciting our glorious constitution. But no, all this happened here, in America, 50 years after slavery ended and almost a century and a half after the drafting of the Bill of Rights. <br/><br/>It's wild to read about how political figures knowingly used forgeries such as <i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i> to push anti-foreign, anti-jew, and anti-bolshevik agendas. It's tempting to think that in the modern age, we are somehow beyond this type of manipulation, yet people today seem no less willing to believe obviously fake content, whether it is anti-science dogma or transparently manufactured news stories. It's tempting to think we are somehow beyond all these toxic feelings, yet we still live in a divided country swamped with anti-immigration sentiment. One could imagine that we are impervious to such miscarriages of justice, yet it seems to be a monthly occurrence that I read about another police officer who killed someone with no consequences.<br/><br/>I think a core message in Hochschild's writing is that our democracy walks a delicate line. Just how far are we today from the society that we have clearly been before? The time period in the book was one marked by intense external stressors and deep uncertainty about the place of each human in society. We have certainly made a lot of progress in the past 100 years on human rights, but if <i>American Midnight</i> is anything to go off of, the wheel of progress can be turned back swiftly and resolutely. <br/><br/>In terms of content, this book was excellent. In terms of narrative and engagement, this is the weaker of the three books I have read so far by Hochschild. Chains and Leopold also covered broad swaths of information, but Hochschild carried you along on the backs of individuals with fascinating stories, whose lives tied together the narrative. Midnight certainly tries to accomplish this same feat, but I think it is ultimately too scattered to accomplish it. I also couldn't stand the narrator, Jonathan Todd Ross; he has the fake inflections of a 3rd grader trying to sound like a news reporter. <br/><br/>The book is definitely a fact-laden slog -- I haven't even come close to encapsulating it in this short review -- but if you are willing to put in the effort, I think it is well worth the read. <br/><br/>[edit] It's been about a week since writing my review, and I've had this nagging feeling that I failed to capture some of the real import of the book. Crucially, how Hochschild highlights the interplay between related tensions, and how I worry that this is important in our time as well. As an example, take racial and labor tensions. He often highlights how tensions between european countries, or between natives and immigrants, were leveraged by companies during strikes, or how black strikebreakers would later be lynched. Then there is the relationship between anti-bolshevik sentiment and anti-feminism. The actual, or imagined, freedom of women in bolshevik society, to divorce, freely choose partners, and live independently was often lumped in with its other supposed negative aspects. I think it's important to realize both ways this was played; bolshevism is bad because we presuppose that women's freedom is bad, but also that women's freedom is bad, because of its association with bolshevism. It seems to me that society often struggles to parse out the pros and cons of a viewpoint; we want to paint a thing as entirely good or entirely bad, without empathy or discretion. Anyway, I've just kinda word vomited this, and should probably come back later and tighten it up. [end edit] <br/><br/>I've left a few quotes that struck me below.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>White rioters tossed a Black child into the fire. When the crowd discovered a Black man who had tried to hide in a large wooden box, they nailed it shut and threw it, too, into the flames.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>A rival politician once called Harding’s verbiage \"an army of pompous phrases moving over the landscape in search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words would actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude.\"<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>A worried psychologist bemoaned the disturbing new times when “spinsters can support themselves with more physical comforts and larger leisure than they would have as wives; when married women may prefer the money they can earn and the excitement they can find in outside employment . . . when they can conveniently leave their husbands should it so suit their fancy” and, worst of all, when “men . . . must compete in the market with women.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Over several days, looking for victims wherever they could find them, the mob killed at least 13 Blacks, one of them a farmworker named Hayes Turner. The next day, his wife, Mary, eight months pregnant, made what a Georgia newspaper called “unwise remarks . . . about the execution of her husband.” The mob strung her up to a tree by her ankles, doused her with gasoline, and set her on fire. As she screamed in pain, a member of the mob knifed open her belly, and when her unborn child fell to the ground and gave a cry, men stomped it to death...<br/>The mob included the foreman of the county’s grand jury. No one was ever prosecuted<br/></blockquote>",

      "my_review": "Meh. Flat characters, weak plot, and unengaging action. Our main characters are met with convenient resolutions at every turn. Absolutely no death was remotely emotional. The villains are boring and the heroes are boring. The author has an irritating tendency to rush through the most interesting parts. Doesn't matter if it is a character growth arc, a romance, or a fight scene...if it seems interesting, Frank Herbert will find a way to skip it. Transparent philosophy and underdeveloped politics. First book really should have been a trilogy or at least a duology. I really struggle to understand the hype.",

Considering its length, this is an easy, easy recommendation. <br/><br/>I've listened to two versions, an annotated one read by Jessica Renfro (which was terrible) and an unadorned original read by Jo Myddleton. The Renfro version was overwrought and haughty, with an annotated introduction that seemed more intent on explaining modern views on the subject than on revealing the context the work was written it. However, in the Jo rendition the main character absolutely leaps from the page, perfectly narrated first as timid, and then descending into unaware madness. I would say that Jo's reading is even superior to what I would have done in my own head.",

      "my_review": "Fantastically imaginative, yet often painfully over-explained, <i>Snow Crash</i> is a book that rarely trusts the intelligence of its reader, and one that often has the reader wondering about the intelligence of its author. <br/><br/>The society portrayed is a fascinatingly fractured, post-capitalist anarchy where the Mafia is a friendly franchise and US government is a parodied enclave. It features a what laughable mix of technology, where software has apparently only progressed 10 years and materials science has progressed 100. It's a world where a 15 year old girl's skateboard has enough nanotechnology to make a US General drool, AI is advanced enough to carry on a conversation but not to summarize a document, and hand knapped glass knives are powerful enough to slice through military-grade bullet proof armor. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that it is a fun book to read, but if you know even the first thing about the scientific or historical concepts being discussed, then by the last chapter your face will be left in a permanent rictus of astonished cringe. For every new topic he explores, it's like he overheard the least important 30 seconds of a one hour lecture on the subject, and then proceeded to expand on his shallow knowledge for a book length treatment. God help me if I have to hear that binary is the universal computer language one more time.<br/><br/>Binary provides an illustrative example. One of his core plot points relies on the premise that binary is the deep language of computers, and that over the course of years of hacking, software engineers internalize it in a meaningful way. Which is ridiculous of course. Yes all computers technically share binary, but nothing approaching a language happens until you get to assembly code, and that will be different for every processor. In biological terms, he's saying something like, atoms are the deep code underlying all life on earth. Technically true, I guess, but the example he was really searching for is DNA. And just like no zookeeper will ever meaningfully internalize the language of DNA, much less atoms, no hacker will ever meaningfully internalize binary. <br/><br/>I mentioned it earlier, but he really, <i>really</i> does not trust the intelligence of the reader. All of his world building is excruciatingly explained, instead of shown through the plot, and every little joke or pun is painfully spelled out. To be fair, he did build a really interesting world full of satire and hijinks, but he's constantly ruining it with his overbearing explanations. I would have loved to have this world revealed organically in the manner of <i>Perdido Street Station</i>. And also to be fair, his does interperse his explanatory expositions with some really wonderfully subversive, off-the-wall descriptions, like his camera case/lingerie comparison that I'll leave at the bottom. <br/><br/>On a more generous day I might have given this book a 4, but I don't think it's the sort of thing I would go around recommending to anyone. There is more to be said about the pacing of the plot and the action, the elements of surrealism, and the book's historical place in the sci-fi canon but I'm sure other reviewers have all explored these elements better than I will.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The top surface of the computer is smooth except for a fisheye lens, a polished glass dome with a purplish optical coating. Whenever Hiro is using the machine, this lens emerges and clicks into place, its base flush with the surface of the computer. The neighborhood loglo is curved and foreshortened on its surface.<br/><br/>Hiro finds it erotic. This is partly because he hasn't been properly laid in several weeks. But there's more to it. Hiro's father, who was stationed in Japan for many years, was obsessed with cameras. He kept bringing them back from his stints in the Far East, encased in many protective layers, so that when he took them out to show Hiro, it was like watching an exquisite striptease as they emerged from all that black leather and nylon, zippers and straps. And once the lens was finally exposed, pure geometric equation made real, so powerful and vulnerable at once, Hiro could only think it was like nuzzling through skirts and lingerie and outer labia and inner labia. . . . It made him feel naked and weak and brave.<br/><br/>The lens can see half of the universe—the half that is above the computer, which includes most of Hiro. In this way, it can generally keep track of where Hiro is and what direction he's looking in.<br/></blockquote>",

The main character's decisions, especially, never seemed to fully line up with the way the author was writing his personality. I'd be a real fan of the ending if I felt like it lined up with the previous character arc, but I really didn't, so I hated it. Overall, I'd definitely say that I liked Under Heaven better.<br/><br/>3 stars is a little harsh...if goodreads offered 3.5 then I would do that.

      "my_review": "Hochschild is excellent as always. Truly fascinating to read about this pivotal moment in history. I won't spend too long on the review; the book was great, everyone should read it. I wrote some thoughts on Hochschild's exceptional historical contextualizing in my review of <i>King Leopold's Ghost</i>.<br/><br/>However I did learn quite a few unexpected things during the reading of this book which I wanted to write down so as not to forget.<br/>- I already knew the journey across the ocean was deadly for slaves, but what I didn't realize was that the journey across africa to the coast is thought to have been even deadlier<br/>- I'm from the American south, and I always had the view that the southern states in America had by far the most slaves and the worst conditions. Apparently this isn't even remotely true: orders of magnitude more slaves were shipped to brazil (5 million compared to only a quarter million), and slavery in the Caribbean islands was far more deadly, necessitating constant shipments of slaves just to keep the population from declining. Even the Netherlands, of all places, shipped almost double the slaves as America.<br/>- when slavery ended in the US, 0.25 million slaves had grown to a population of 4 million. When it ended in the British West Indies, a imported population of well over 2 million slaves had died off to only leave 670k. In the words of Hochschild, 'The Caribbean was a slaughterhouse.'<br/>- the literal Church of England owned murdering slave plantations, and the Bishop of Canterbury was fully aware of the death rate and chose to do nothing about it<br/>- a country-wide abolition movement in Britain was casually halted by war with France. It was absolutely horrible to read how such a popular and beautiful movement was crushed so easily by the government and society during a time of panic and war. Hochschild has an entire book on a similar period in America during the 20s, and I am anxious to read it. I feel that far too little time was ever spent in my own education on understanding how an entire population gets caught up in a populist fervor with often dismal consequences. <br/>- I had never previously put 2 and 2 together to understand how big of an impact press ganging sailors must have had on British sentiments towards slavery<br/>- the amount of casual rape and murder committed by all countries and all peoples will never cease to astonish me, no matter how many historical narratives validate it as the status quo in almost all places and all times. When I was younger, I used to read of lurid scenes in historical fiction and shake my head at an over-excited author. However the more history I read, the more I think that most authors are actually underselling the horrors of the past",

      "my_review": "What an incredible book. Hochschild unpacks this devastating period of human history in a way that does great credit to his background as both a journalist and historian. He crushes you under the weight of the atrocities in the Congo while still giving a full picture of the political, societal, and personal contexts. Where historical documentation allows, he delves deep into the fascinating stories of all the main characters, and the historical narrative often reads as interesting as a novel.<br/><br/>Complete understanding of the actions and beliefs of individuals in the far past is often obscured by the mists of changing times and social norms. It is the responsibility of any decent historian to use their deeper knowledge to contextualize the past for the reader's benefit. Today, the mindsets of the colonizer and the oppressed may seem so far removed as to be incomprehensible. Yet Hochschild carefully explains the past, in a way that lets us judge characters by both the standards of their time, and our own.<br/><br/>What results is a riveting account that feels balanced and full bodied. He'll read you the sappy love letters of the villains to their wives while revealing the myriad failings of the heros. And the book is so much the better for it. <br/><br/>There was apparently much recorded as to the many atrocities committed in the Congo, via the numerous letters and investigations of the time, and although Hochschild certainly gave them their due, I would not have minded even more time spent detailing them.<br/><br/>Overall I was quite impressed, and by the time of putting this review to paper, I have already read a second book by Hochschild and intend to read at least one more.",

      "my_review": "Absolutely excellent. This book is a tour de force on sleep which should be a part of every school curriculum and required reading for every legislator. <br/><br/>Dr. Matthew Walker effortlessly walks the line between keeping the book interesting and readable while still cramming it full of science. He consistently covers the known mechanisms by which sleep and its associated processes operate and effect the body, considers both correlational and causal meta studies, and gives actionable recommendations for your own life. <br/><br/>Amongst a sea of bad health recommendations, poorly considered studies, and a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms, <i>Why We Sleep</i> stands far above the rest, with its clear science and engaging writing. This is the kind of book that I'm already itching to read a second time, just to make sure that I fully absorbed all of the material. Highly, highly recommend.",

Interesting enough to read fully and good information, but I really felt like it left a lot of potential excitement on the table. It did a great job of contextualizing the adventure narrative (probably half the book was contex), but when we got to the adventure itself, it just felt like a dry recitation of facts, instead of an epic journey. <br/><br/>To be fair, this wasn't that long of a book, but I still almost wish that I had read the Wikipedia page instead, and used my time on something else.",

      "my_review": "Heartbreaking. This is a soul-crushing account of the Japanese invasion and massacre of Nanking. It's told with clarity and impact, and the atrocities it details left my stomach churning.<br/><br/>I read a fair bit of non-fiction, and not all of it well-written, so I was worried that this book received high rankings only out of respect for the subject matter and not for the writing. But no, this is a 5 star book in every category. Iris Change deftly guides the reader through the historical landscape, contextualizing the social environment of the Japanese military in the years building up to WWII. In a concise and devastating volume, she takes us through every important aspect of the atrocity, covering the civilian, military, and global reactions, as well as the then current (late 90s) political and social response in Japan. At no point does the book bog down in the details, and you are always itching to turn the next page.<br/><br/>She clearly gives all the facts, and this is in no way a hit-piece on the Japanese people as a whole. She is just as eager to reveal the original atrocity and the subsequent government coverups as she is to highlight the Japanese who lost their jobs trying to publicize the massacre. <br/><br/>In all, this is a magnificently well-crafted and unbiased accounting of a relatively unknown period of rape, torture, and murder on the scale of 100s of thousands of Chinese civilians. It will break your heart, and it should be required reading in every school.",

      "my_review": "Exciting, decent twists, great action. Great end to a great series.<br/><br/>I wish I had read it closer to the First Law Trilogy, so I could evaluate which one I liked more. I really like the way that he slowly disintegrates relationships for genuinely good reasons. Fiction is full of authors who seem to think that a small miscommunication is enough to doom a romance, and Abercombie never falls into that trap. Relationships are ruined by deep resentment, lies, self-pity, jealousy, and violence. <br/><br/>I really loved some of the final character revelations. Some I saw coming, and others totally surprised me and were perfect. The same was true of the plot twists. Some were predictable, others were literally predicted, but others caught me quite by surprise. I think a real power in Abercrombie's writing is that even if I felt like I had predicted the outcome, I was nonetheless very excited to see how it would come to pass.",

      "my_review": "Look. I love the idea of an idyllic natural utopia as much as the next guy. What I don't love is clumsy writing, aborted character growth, manufactured personal trauma, awkward character interactions, and transparent sermonizing.<br/><br/>Instead of crafting an immersive world whose tender beauty needs no salespitch, Chambers seems to have made a big neato list of all the bestest utopian ideals which she proceeds to shove into every available paragraph. It reminds me of Huxley's <i>The Island</i>, where characters, plot, and philosophy all take a back seat to thinly veiled evangelizing. <br/><br/>Consider the lifetime computers<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It was a good computer, given to them on their sixteenth birthday, a customary coming-of-age gift...and Dex had only needed to repair it five times in the years that it had traveled in their clothes. A reliable device built to last a lifetime, as all computers were.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I mean, yeah, I also think the right to repair act is neato and planned obsolescence is a blight on society. But what does this have to do with our story about an emotionally conflicted tea monk? Can you at least <i>pretend</i> that you are world building and not just checking cool things of your utopian checklist?<br/><br/>The problem isn't all the cool details of the utopia. It's how the reader learns of them. The universally accepted ideas of your world should not be carefully laid out in fabricated internal monologues. They are ingrained in society, and should be naturally revealed through the actions of the characters.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Disturbing these lives (plants/bugs) through digging was a violence—though sometimes a needed one...the human residents of this place were judicious about what constituted actual necessity, and as such, disturbed the ground as little as possible.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Imagine if I wrote the following:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Punching other subway riders in the face was a violence—though sometimes a needed one. The human residents of NYC were judicious about what constituted actual necessity, and as such, punched as few of their fellow citizens in the face as possible.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Imagine the character who has this internal monologue. They've got a screw loose, right? Is that how the author means for us to think about Dex? As a possibly disturbed and weirdly reflective outsider? Absolutely not. Dex is meant to be a functioning and conforming member of society with a mild crisis about their life's meaning. These kind of internal dialogues are wrong for Dex's character. This is the author preaching to us, not Dex thinking things in their own head.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Sigh. Let's move on to character development and conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Wait, conflict resolution? What conflict resolution? In the two key conflicts, it is external events that conveniently conspire to force the characters to get along. <spoiler>When first fighting with the robot, a bear comes. When next fighting the robot, Dex falls off a cliff. In both occurrences, the unexpected external event forces Dex to change their mind and accept the robot.</spoiler> There is no actual growth and understanding that comes from inside Dex. <br/><br/>And character development. Oh the character development. Our MC is supposed to have felt a vague dissatisfaction with life that led them to become a tea monk and then to travel into the wilds. Except, we don't get to see any of that. As soon as we see the first tea ceremony's failure, the author just hand waves two years and now Dex is the best tea monk on the entire moon? And is mildly depressed for some reason? <br/><br/>This next point may have bothered me more because I listened to this as an audiobook, and there is no reasonable way to glance back or ahead a few words with the ease that is possible when sight reading.<br/><br/>For starters, let's all agree that respecting people's pronouns is a basic human courtesy and it's not up for debate. I don't want to see a bunch of weirdos in the comments saying that 'they' shouldn't be a pronoun. Singular they has a long history in formal writing, and I dunno, how bout we just respect what people want to be called?<br/><br/>However, 'they' is often a harder pronoun to use unambiguously, and when you're an author who can plan each sentence and you have an editor to proofread each sentence, I don’t want to constantly wonder who exactly 'they' is. Just...use 'they' when it's obvious and use 'Dex' when it's not. As an audiobook listener, I was constantly having to wait four or five words after hearing 'they' before I could figure out whether 'they' referred to Dex or if it referred to the group of people mentioned in the previous sentence.<br/><br/>Anyway, what about the book's core philosophy? That there is no inherent meaning to life and we should accept this and forge our own meanings? <br/><br/>Well, that's basically my life philosophy too, but again, like with the utopia, it's not enough that I agree with you and like the world you're presenting. Books need to be fun to read. They need to engage me and seem natural. They need to make me feel stuff. This book did not do those things. It just felt like a bland recitation of agreeable ideas with a thin veneer of characters and plot painted lazily on top.",

      "my_review": "Halfway through this book I was very frustrated. Book 1 was better, I though to myself, a lot better. The second half improved a bit, especially the ending, but it still wasn't as good as the first.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's complicated to tease out exactly what was wrong with a book, especially when the outline of the plot is so promising. I honestly think that with a better editor this book could have been great. But somehow what used to be exciting is now just eye-rolling. And the amount of weak writing with characters and plot was painful. Especially since it would often have been simple to leave out the offending portions. <br/><br/>It's hard to remember every element I didn't like, but let me just hit some of the highlights. For starters, evil characters who are evil just for sake of evil. There are better ways to create conflict in a story than simply postulating an evil character. It would have been so easy to give the Vice Commandant a meaningful backstory, but instead we got this one dimensional, lame villain. <br/><br/>And then there is the artificial tension. Every small thing doesn't need to be life or death for no reason; it gets old and boring after a while, especially when there are obvious reasons for there to be no death. Like when that girl died jumping across a trap...so preventable. We could have cut out that entire scene and the book would have improved.  <br/><br/>And everyone's least favorite character being alive? In the plot outline, it's a great idea, and really sets us up for the ending. But like, from a continuity and world building sense? It's terrible. It really reads like she hadn't planned this in book one, and added it as a cool idea when book two came around. Not to mention, how the hell does this fit into the whole idea of the wards? Why haven't there been centuries worth of people taking the same choice as Jack?<br/><br/>And the 7 dragons thing... Hiding younglings was one thing; it had a plot-justified purpose. But hiding the 7th dragon was just meaningless. And why the hell did Andaurna let every one fail at ward 1, and then continue to keep it a secret for ward 2? This just reads like ill-considered plot that a competent editor should have cut out.<br/><br/>The romance was definitely not as good. To be fair, I'm usually far more interested in the chase than in the actual relationship, but even accounting for this, their relationship just lacked pizzaz. Definitely no lip-biting from me in this book.<br/><br/>There was some good stuff. Definitely still liking the non-glorification of toxicity. Like when Xaden wants to be all weird and protective and Violet is like, fuck that. Most of his flaws seem to be correctly called out instead of being portrayed as standard or desirable. Additionally, the secrets conflict felt pretty reasonable and true to how YAs actually behave. The battles were ok, but I think they needed some work. And the ending was pretty great. Really liked the death and the conversion.<br/><br/>Overall a mixed bag. It's a fast read, so it's worth it to continue the series. Just don't expect it to live up to book one.",

Frankly, I was prepared for Twilight with dragons.<br/><br/>But wow, this was actually not bad. Yes, it was predictable at times, but I always found myself excited when my predictions came true, instead of rolling my eyes. Yes, there was an overprotective, overstrong male interest, but he wasn't always saving mc physically. He gave her better daggers, made her a saddle, in short, showed that he cared in healthy, intentional ways. Yes, male mc occasionally does creepy protective things. But mc never glorifies it; she tells him to stop. Yes, there was communication as a plot device, but it always seemed real to how actual teens behave. Yes, there was silly plot stuff here and there, but I actually found myself getting excited at parts. Yes, the quietly dangerous male mc smoldered from his towering height as the sharp edge of his jaw threatened to cut his rippling abs. But I still found myself biting my lip in the casual interactions as their relationship sparked.<br/><br/>If I read more romantasy, maybe the \"totally platonic",

You won't really learn a ton of new basic core science concepts, but there are still so many neat real world examples of microbes. When I got to the end, I was really wishing that I had written more of them down. <br/><br/>Stuff like, breast milk has special chemicals that we don't usefully digest, but are rather specifically tailored to feed our microbiome. Or that there are bacteria which change the sex ratios of their hosts. Or that toilets are actually the most susceptible to harboring dangerous pathogens recently after being cleaned.<br/><br/>A very important core topic is that a robust microbiome is typically the enemy of pathogens. This is as true in the gut as it is in the hospital air. Additionally, the stomach microbiome is very vulnerable to food diversity and antibiotics.<br/><br/>Overall, this book has a refreshingly positive take on bacteria as a fundamental part of our worlds, and even if it isn't the best book I've ever read, it is definitely worth a read.",

      "my_review": "So good. I've never been disappointed with a Simon Singh book, and this one is no exception. He knows just how to tell a scientific story without grossly simplifing it, and he deftly builds your interest in the characters and their stories. He does this while going deeper than other authors, and uncovering details that I'd never previously heard of. <br/><br/>If you don't already know how the story ends, do yourself a favor and don't read the intro first.",

      "my_review": "A 200 page masterclass in making the interesting boring. Sobel takes the fascinating progress of early science, the flaming vitriol of of men competing for the Longitude Prize, and renders it devoid of all intrigue and suspense. If there were instead a prize for neutering great stories, Sobel would handily win it. <br/><br/>Every page reeks with untapped potential. Because even an educated reader has only a vague idea of the exact happenings in the 1700s fight for the longitude prize, a blow by blow retelling could easily make a book of great suspense and scientific interest. Yet Sobel consistently robs her work of any semblance of excitement by spoiling every great moment hundreds of pages before its narrative conclusion, constantly insisting on telling key events out of line.<br/><br/>Blessed with an abundance of first hand literature and documents, she <i>could have</i> regaled us with the pointed words of the original combatants. And yet instead she chooses to dully recite the facts in a dry wikipedia summarization. <br/><br/>I was so excited to read a book-length treatment on this fascinating topic, and so let down by the actual experience.",

I loved the author's refusal to use names. I gotta say that I absolutely hated the ending though, and it somewhat spoiled it for me. For such a bleak, realistic, and hard-hitting book to have such a forced, unbelievable, and happy ending was just too out of place and silly. However, I would still easily put this above other works such as The Parable of The Sower and Station Eleven.",

      "my_review": "This book has it ALL. Murder, intrigue, engineering, catastrophe, death, economic collapse, sickness, and name dropping you wouldn't believe.<br/><br/>I get the impression that a lot of people are miffed that there wasn't more serial killer stuff, and that they grew tired of the world's fair. I heartily disagree. I would have loved another 100 pages on the exibits of the fair and the inventors and products that came of it. <br/><br/>Upon finishing, I was pretty tempted to give this a five stars, simply by virtue of how interesting I found it on every page. SO MUCH STUFF that I had no idea about happened in this time frame. There's an endless parade of names that leaves me constantly exlaiming, \"that person was there too!?\"<br/><br/>But anyway, I think the author did an excellent job of picking the most interesting tidbits and weaving them into a cohesive multi-thread narrative. There was once or twice when I thought he took some liberties with explaining people's thoughts during a murder, but listening to the audiobook, I'm not sure if he actually had quotes here from letters or whatnot. <br/><br/>Similar to <i>The Wager</i>, with this amount of source material (Holmes wrote several confessions) I might have wished for more frequent straight regurgitations of old info. It really is a shame that the several dozen witnesses were not allowed testimony at the trial. <br/><br/>This book was a ton of fun, and I'll be promptly combing through his other works to find something intersting to read.",

      "my_review": "Fascinating and horrifying. I sometimes had a little trouble keeping track of the huge cast of characters, but overall I was swept away by this insane story of the calculated murder of entire families of Osage indians. <br/><br/>Obviously I learned about the trail of tears and indian reservations and whatnot in school, but I can't say that I really understood the scope of the mistreatment that occurred <i>after</i> they got on reservations. Reading about the system of guardianship was sickening. To think that you would have a grown human being worth millions of dollars and they would have a white 'guardian' that would prevent them from spending any money to save their sick children from dying is disgusting.<br/><br/>Grann makes a convincing case that, not only did Hale mastermind the murder of dozens of people to steal their inheritances, but also that unknown swaths of conspirators murdered indians in secret for the better part of two decades and covered up the evidence. It's insane to think that you would have the doctors, the coroner, and the law agent in cahoots as you brought a drunk man in, executed him with morphine, and then classified it as alcohol poisoning. Or that you would systematically poison people's moonshine and never get caught.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was a wild tale, and I plan on seeing the movie when it comes out. Also kinda interesting, the book was in three parts and a different narrator read each one.",

      "my_review": "It's strange. Objectively speaking, there is so much to dislike in this book. <br/><br/>The random preaching, the weird fixation on music, the way Murakami's writing makes me wonder if he has ever had adult relations with a human female....and yet somehow, I really quite enjoyed myself. <br/><br/>It's a weird thing. The plot is just plain silly, and there are constant Deus ex Machinas, but it's just so pleasant to vibe with the story as it flows along.<br/><br/>I can only imagine how good Murakami's books would be if they weren't littered with weird problems. Anyway, to sum up, I'd say Wind up Bird was better.<br/><br/>Side note: if I have to hear the narrator Sean Barrett butcher one more perfectly easy to pronounce Japanese name or city, I'm going to rip my own ears off. I mean sure, if it were something in Arabic that's legitimately hard for an english speaker, I could understand. But this sociopath pronounces Takamura, as \"TACK-eh-MURE-ah\". How this narration made it through multiple human beings with internet access is beyond me.",

      "my_review": "what a strange and captivating book. i'll need to come back and write a more serious review, but for now let's just say that I plan on adding a few more by Murakami to my reading list.<br/><br/>One could hardly accuse this book of having a clear plot-line, what with the constant interjections of historical war stories, accounts of girls off in rural wig factories, and a persistent blurring of reality, magic, and dream. However, I nonetheless found myself turning page after page, desperate to know how the stories would unfold.<br/><br/>Flashbacks often prod the bored reader into wishing for the renewal of the main storyline, yet in this book, one might almost call the flashbacks the most interesting part. Or, if not the most interesting, certainly the most action filled.<br/><br/>Is this just a story? Or is Murakami saying something deep about the human condition? Is his book filled with strong female characters? Or are they persistently sexualized vessels for the plot? <br/><br/>Before reading this novel, I was given the impression that it was a high-brow read, and I can certainly understand how it might achieve that reputation.",

      "my_review": "pitiful end to an increasingly mediocre series. <br/><br/>especially in the first 4 or so books, the characters were woefully one-dimensional, like a moralizing children's tale that is required to have clear delineations of right and wrong, good and evil. This makes for a tepid read, where even if there's technically action or plot, it somehow manages to bore. <br/><br/>And as the series reached it's end, long built-up relationships and conflicts just fizzled out pitifully. The supposed great conflict arc between the two brothers had no climax, much less a conclusion. And the way the two used their powers was consistently lame. The first couple books were great, as a young Alvin explored the limits of his skills. But grown-up Alvin was such an unbelievable bore. And writer Orson Scott Card completely lacked the ability to wow the reader with the scenes that were certainly intended to be amazing. <br/><br/>A shitty bridge across water is the coolest thing Alvin ever does? Um, you mean like ice? As a maker how just tells molecules how they should be, and they carry on the instructions, the basic fundamentals of the magic system make it clear that creating an ice bridge should be trivial. And yet for some silly reason we are asked to be amazed by this \"crystal\" bridge he builds. Not to mention this lame-ass plow he carries around everywhere. <br/><br/>I suspect that much of the lame plot stemmed from a need to maintain some type of symmetry with Mormon myths and \"symbolism\" in early books. <br/><br/>I've recently recommended some other Orson Scott Card books to people, like Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide, and I shudder to think that childhood may have clouded my vision, and in fact these books are as bad as the Alvin Maker series.<br/><br/>In summary, Orson managed to take a freaking awesome premise -- magical realism in early 1800s frontier america -- and bore the reader to tears with one-dimensional characters, lame mormon shout outs, characters that refused to use their magic in interesting ways, and a weird absence of a meaningful climax or resolution.",

      "my_review": "you know, there's nothing wrong with these books. i certainly enjoy them. and I can absolutely see why I must have enjoyed them as a child. I would have <i>adored</i> all this indian and magic pioneer days stuff. Actually, I have a very rare memory of selecting this series in the library, while looking for another book altogether. And I remember loving the magic, the way he crafted the stone and healed his own body in book 1. It's pretty rare for me to remember stuff from that long ago, much less something only in a book, so this must have left quite the impression. But despite the death and the torture and the grown up characters, this nonetheless feels like a child's tale. Hard to say what it is, exactly. Maybe it's overly moralizing? Hard to say. It's not like I bristle at the moral message, it's just that it has the kind of message an intentionally-crafted children's movie would have.",

This is my 8th pratchett book in 9 days, and I've gotten to the point where the guaranteed low-stakes can no longer hold my interest. <br/><br/>This was good, certainly better than Mort, and I think the narrator came a little more into her own, although she still does not do nearly so well as Indira did. I kinda zoned out during the last hour of the book tho. Hard to say whether I'm just burned out on Pratchett or if the book really would have otherwise failed to keep my interest. <br/><br/>I have been thinking that I need to go and read some books out of the main wizard series, maybe starting with Sourcery and then reading a few in chronological publication order.",

      "my_review": "Holy info-dump batman! The thinly disguised info-dumps are painful, the instantaneous lovey-dovey relationship stretches belief, and certain details really bothered me. Especially during the beginning, I found myself wishing I'd just watched the movie 3 times instead of reading this book.. It did get more engaging near the end, but I don't think it made the slog worth it.<br/><br/>Ludlum over-explains <i>everything</i>. Every super-mega-cool-WOW spy detail needs it's initial Ph.D. dissertation when first introduced, and then at every subsequent occurrence needs a little ELI5 just in case the reader forget how it works during the intervening 20 pages. Yes, I understand that the neato spy details are part of what makes it a fun spy novel, but at some point the author needs to give the reader's intelligence some credit.<br/><br/>And the downfall of the fashion shop was just plain silly. What a lame climax. Carlos and the fashion lady both know that Bourne has compromised the shop, and it didn't scare them a bit. And then he terrifies the organization by....by making the shop seem compromised? What the hell is this plot point??<br/><br/>And not just that, but Carlos is built up as having this far reaching organization of disconnected tendrils, and then I'm suddenly supposed to believe that there's some kind of need for the fashion shop to be a base of operations which is even possible to compromise? Yeah, tldr, I could have done without this plot point.<br/><br/>Bourne's and his lady's emotional interactions were also pretty weird. He was always flying off the handle, she was always perfectly loving and composed. Even setting aside the datedness of the relationship, it's just not good character writing.",

      "my_review": "I think this is the worst of the past 7 discworld novels I've read, even including Equal Rites. Both the characters and the humor were lacking. Pratchett, who is usually so excellent at crafting unique and interesting characters, just kinda disappointed. The personalities of the two female co-leads were shallow and tepid. I didn't find either to be engaging, and I certainly wasn't rooting for any romantic pairings...a huge letdown after the strong characters of the Witches sub-series. And death had some really strange personality shifts that didn't make sense to me. The way he acted after coming back from the kitchens was very out of character, or at least, not backed up by good narration.<br/><br/>I guess this makes sense, seeing as I'm moving from reading the 23rd discword book to reading the 4th. I'm still somewhat undecided as to whether this reading order I've got going makes sense. But I think it's probably nice to mix in the older (and less refined) books with the newer and better ones. Otherwise, I'm not sure that I would be able to plow through a bunch of these tepid books in order to get to the better, later works. <br/><br/>Also, I was really enjoying the narrator Indira Varma from Witches, and her replacement, Sian Clifford was very disappointing by comparison. Whereas Indira's voices feel genuine, Sian's feel fake and put-on, with stage emotion instead of true feeling.",

      "my_review": "Another fun Pratchett book. It's an earlier work, so maybe not as sophisticated as the later ones, but I rather enjoyed it. I don't know that it really deserves as low as 3 stars, but I'm not quite ready to put it up with all the 4 star books, as it's not a particularly strong recommendation unless you are already a Pratchett fan, or are looking for something light and fun.<br/><br/>It was written in the 1980s and is a criticism/satire of the unequal way that witches and wizards are historically portrayed in fantasy. It’s about a girl that wants to grow up to be a wizard, but everyone wants her to be a witch instead, cuz, you know, wizards are all strong fireballs and dragons, and witches are all weak herbs and potions or whatever.<br/><br/>Of course, it rings a little less true in 2023, when it's probably easier to find badass female fireball magicians than it is to find stereotypical, looked-down-upon herb-hags. But it was still fun, and I'll enjoy reading the rest of the series.<br/><br/>If one was very worried about introducing someone to pratchett, maybe they could start with Wyrd sisters instead? This one really doesn't have too much in common with the other books that I've seen.<br/><br/>Oh, and the narrator, Indira Varma, was *excellent* especially when she starts doing voices in the second book",

      "my_review": "It's a pretty interesting book. It's intentionally humorous and doesn't take itself seriously at all. Has a fun, light plot, where you know everything will work out, but are interested in staying along for the ride to find out how. It's peppered with occasional deeper bits of philosophy and introspection, and has a nicely varied vocabulary. The style of writing took me maybe 20 pages to really get immersed in, but ultimately it became natural and I enjoyed it. It relies very strongly on the social and political dynamics of the specific city that it is based in, and the unique personalities of its inhabitants, in order to drive the story forward. Overall, I enjoyed reading it, but it doesn't make my list of strong recommendations, and I wouldn't consider reading it a second time.  I have this vague feeling that the author wasn't making full use of the characters, but this could very well be because it is book 1 of an 8 book series. It has a very clear and satisfying story arc, with an ending that nicely concludes the plot while still allowing more to be written",

      "my_review": "Don't have as much to say about book 3. More world building, more character development, good plot, enjoyable. However, it lacked the tense excitement of book 2, and fell more strongly into feel of book 1. The author is careful to grow the world with each book, so you always are learning and experiencing new aspects of the universe, while he incorporates all the elements with which you are already familiar. It still has the characteristic humor mixed in with deeper musings about the nature of man and society. Interesting topics are naturally and organically explored through the characters like femininity and gender bias through dwarves, well-intentioned prejudices through werewolfs, and the nature of self and religion through golems. I never feel brow beaten by any particular musing. In terms of enjoyment I rank it similar to book 1, maybe a bit higher?, and noticeably less than book 2.",

      "my_review": "This really hits its stride. Races and world-building that were previously only hinted at are now fleshed out wonderfully. You get an entirely new understanding of the city and its guilds and political machinations. The main character's personality explodes onto the page, satiating every unfulfilled desire I had in book 1. The story artfully brings in new and interesting characters while progressing the stories of the old favorites. It maintains its humor, but gone is the comfortable feeling that everything will work out in the end. The story features tense action, and real suspense. Cold dread washed over me at certain points, and I found myself excitedly cheering on the action. It nicely builds little plot points which are hinted at in the early stages and then revealed to effect during the climax and conclusion. Overall I was much more engaged, and I enjoyed the read thoroughly.",

      "my_review": "I can't help but feel that plum was a sadly underdeveloped supporting character, looking back, I know we spent a lot of time with her, but I don't feel that I know her at all. I really liked Alice's emotional journey after coming back from being a niffin, how she was still alien and furious at the transformation. It was handled quickly in terms of page count, but it was solid and satisfying. I like the idea of the flesh taking over with the food etc, as smells and desires came back online after the 7 year hiatus. It's really nice to see how characters develop in our abscence, asmo with the blade, Poppy and his legion of golden-handed followers in the library, Julia on the other side of fillory. All of this was handled well and believably. As with book 2, there was much less emotional exploration, but perhaps that's what is is like to be a mostly stable adult instead of a turbulent teenager. The stuff with Alice more than made up for it. I enjoyed the plot, the robbery, and the trip to see the artic professor, and the school hijinks, and Q becoming god. I think it would have been easy to fall into the trap of an unanbiguously happy ending, and I'm glad that wasn't the case. Interesting, though, that I can't think that this book contained any real loss. I appreciate it ending with Q and Alice still reservered and distant, still figuring things out. Overall I quite enjoyed it, and it was an excellent conclusion to the series. I don't think I'll be raving about this series and recommending it to everyone I see, but it will be high on my list. Books 1 and 3 were the strongest; book 3 was easily the most polished, and book 1 stands out for it's excellent emotional and character content. Side note that I am very very bothered by how it was never really mentioned that the children should have been many years older than they actually were supposed to be on earth. A brief note about growing an inch taller, but nothing more. I felt like it should have been brought up in reference to their often mentioned ages, which should have been much more difficult to calculate due to all the time spent in Fillory.",

      "my_review": "I remember finding the writing to be very captivating when I opened the book. The writer makes heavy use of similes and metaphors in a way that I thought I might get tired of, but I stopped noticing as the book progressed. I was originally a bit put off by what I felt was a self-pleasuring, self-referential inclusion of a fantasy story about magicians within the fantasy story about magicians, although this feeling, too, faded with progress. The greater part of the book is somewhat jarringly episodic, bouncing from scene to scene through the years unexpectedly, sometimes skipping details that I would have quite liked to know (like what happens after the water jump with Alice). In this way, it managed to lack a cohesive narrative thread, while perhaps instead focusing on the emotional journey of Quentin et al. <br/><br/>As a whole, I found the interpersonal relationships to be very complex and satisfying, and perhaps even realistic. Maybe I don’t read enough anymore, but I think it is uncommon to write in such detail about such interactions. The fantasy and narrative of the novel took a real backstage to the often strained, and complicated human relationships. Group dynamics, in particular, were very interestingly portrayed, whether it was uncomfortable in-group tension or the various feelings you have as part of a clique. Constant sexual noticing of breasts really stood out, but then again, this was exactly what it was like to be a teenage boy. There were some points when Q reflected on leaving college that left me with panging nostalgia. <br/><br/>And of course there is the climax in fantasy land. It had a sort of hurried, overwhelming feel, with the changes coming in faster than the descriptions, very possibly intentionally done by the author. The end fight was great with the shock of Penny’s hands, the uselessness of Q, and the absolute bad-assery of Alice, and I was left with a deep and perfect crushing hollowness when she horrifyingly died right when she seemed at the cusp of victory. Important characters were tossed aside in a way that felt very real to actual meaningless disasters. <br/><br/>The two training montages, the first during the arctic and the second during Fillory were really excellent, and everything I love about training montages. But they had absolutely no payoff after their little story arc. I never had any sense that in the following narratives, Q had grown as a magician. He didn’t seem to have outpaced his classmates after the arctic, and honestly he almost never uses magic at all. In the fights following the arctic, he was uniformly outclassed and useless, worse than his peers who it would have seemed that he should be better than. And the aftermath of the Fillory montage was just pathetic. I expected him to be a badass magician afterwards, but instead, nothing. He can’t manage to fly across the water or anything. It was really disappointing. The book ended somewhat abruptly, definitely not the sort of thing that has good closure, very much feeling like part of an uncompleted series. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the book and will read the next ones with interest.",

      "my_review": "I didn't enjoy this as much. The narrative flow was much smoother and less episodic, and it tracked two story lines instead of one, Julia's past and Q's present. Julia's past was the more engaging of the two stories, and the plot was really great. However, the heavy emotional scenes, such as the final murder of her witch family, lacked the emotional punch of Alice's death in book 1. There were deep parallels between the two scenes. For Alice, Q realized right before her death just how much he loved her, and he experienced true clarity about his life/their relationship, only for her to almost immediately be taken from him. With J, as the final spell was being cast, she finally had clarity and understood that the witch family was everything she had been searching for, only for it to be immediately destroyed before her eyes, and for her self to be ravaged and destroyed as well. But Alice's death left a cold chill on my heart, and J's friends death just read like so many words on a page. The author just didn't manage to build the necessary emotional connection. This problem plagued book 2 in general. I rarely felt that social relationships and emotions were as nuanced and well-explored as in book 1. Honestly the outline of the plot for book 2 may be even better/more enjoyable than book 1, but the details of relationships and emotional exploration and my personal investment in the plot and characters were fundamentally lacking. I do think the overarching details of the plot were good. I love the unfairness of it all, Julia's family being massacred, Bennidict dying, Q being kicked out of Narnia, etc, I just wasn't as engaged with the characters and their emotional journies.",

      "my_review": "You ever read a book that leaves you hollowed out inside, too numb at the gnawing pain to feel the tear crawling its way down your face? That's Demon Copperhead.<br/><br/>I honestly struggled a bit in the beginning to lose myself in the story, but by the second half I was in a constant struggle to hold back the tears as I plowed through the pages, desperately wishing for the trainwreck to end.<br/><br/>After reading Poisonwood Bible, I had every confidence in Kingsolver's ability to write <i>female</i> characters, but I was honestly shocked at how effortlessly teenage boy Demon flowed onto the page. Having been a hormone addled teenage boy myself, I can vouch that she nails his character. <br/><br/>And the setting. Demon grows up in Lee County (Lee was a confederate general) going to a high school with a highly winning football team called the Generals, despite their ancestors fighting for the Union (due to having no plantations), located somewhere in the rural Virginia mountains, a little north of Knoxville. Meanwhile, I grew up a little south of Knoxville, nestled in the Tennessee mountains...and despite our city fighting for the Union, our highly winning high school football team was the Rebels, complete with the confederate flag that, like Demon, we mostly found to be a weird mixture of familiar and acutely embarrassing. <br/><br/>To be fair, there are some major differences between our childhoods and towns, but I've lived close enough to all this to say that holy mother of god does Barbara nail the small-town, rural Appalachian setting. I've been to the impossibly huge family gatherings, where food is laid out on every truck bed. I've watched the foster-care family members have so much promise, and then lose their freedom to bad decisions in a world that doesn't give a shit how young or broken you are. I've known the girls with the babies that end their education at 16, and the girls who would rather forget they ever had anyone called father. <br/><br/>In short, I guess I've scribbled a bunch of words to say one thing: this book is heartbreakingly realistic, with complicated, captivating characters, and a plot that will rip your soul out. <br/><br/>Goodreads kinda sucks at quotes, so I leave anything that struck me here.<br/><blockquote><br/>I wanted to tell them it's not just girls that end up inside four walls of hate, with knuckles for breakfast.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Girls my age seemed young. More heavily into showcasing the goods than to backing up the inventory.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>I was high on wanting. Now I had her, and all the air hissed out. I was living life as a flat tire.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Dory crying. Saying I hated her. It broke me to pieces. All she wanted in the world was to be loved. I had to think of her as my baby doll. You don't blame a doll for slacking. You watch the pretty eyes open and shut.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>One of those hot rainy days you feel like you're breathing your own breath out of a paper bag.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>A fallen hero shatters into more sharp pieces than you'd believe. <br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>The well-oiled machine he'd worked so hard to keep, a long time after it really mattered. What a waste, a dead body. With most of its parts still eager and ready to work. The final humiliation of a man. The last layoff.<br/></blockquote>",

      "my_review": "Had a ton of fun, couldn't put it down. There was a thing here and a thing there that I didn't love. Pol was sometimes conveniently weak for the sake of being saved by Taniel, and the army at large was grossly ignorant of her powers to an unbelievable extent. The whole generals-hate-tamil sub-plot seemed just slightly unrealistic (I think he would have garnered more respect), but I went with it. And there were some key fights prolonged for the sake of making the fight cooler (Tamis vs the handless mage, when he should have just shot him from the shadows). But in general, the good far outweighed the bad. It was exciting, kept multiple interesting plots going, and satisfied all those fun magical-gun-fight itches. Very much looking forward to book 3.<br/><br/>Does a pretty decent job of balancing all the different genres. Criminal underworld, military campaign, magical mysteries, political investigating, hot-shot-fighting mage, etc. <br/><br/>I'm always kind of prepared for male-written fantasy to have a certain kind of male gaze, but I think this book is pretty acceptable in that regard. The female character writing isn't particularly strong, but this isn't one of those breasted boobily down the hallway books. You can tell the author put some attempts at strong females, even if he doesn't always nail it. The harems contain beautiful women AND men, the officers in the army are casually female, many of the villains are female, one of the best powder mages is a woman, but we do still end up with some damsel tropes.",

You see the world through the character's eyes, and if it isn't something they would have thought to comment on, then they don't. The details of the world are casually and naturally concealed from the reader until suddenly you're like, <spoiler>holy shit, wait, she's a fucking insect!?</spoiler>.  It's rare to read a world so artfully revealed (Handmaid's Tale comes to mind) and it is always a pleasure.<br/><br/>The fantasy world itself was quite interesting, and hardly derivative. I think if the book failed anywhere it would be plot, which was maybe a little drawn out and cheesy? This is definitely the sort of thing I would recommend to the right reader.",

It defies even the natural suspension of belief to think that people with arbitrary transportation couldn't catch our protagonists while they spent every day laying god damn train tracks. Sure, the look into politics and intrigue was neat, and I don't regret reading the book for more of the world, but it is definitely not a strong recommendation like perdido is.",

      "my_review": "Sermon masquerading as a narrative. The worst part is that I rather liked some key messages in Huxley's sermon, but see, I was hoping to read...you know...a book. Huxley could have given the world a much more engaging piece of literature if he had only revealed this utopia in true narrative form, perhaps from the viewpoint of the lifetime of the two children, the island girl and the prince. We could have followed them as they grew, felt the depths of their worldviews, seen the pain of their conflict. We would have identified with both of them, and had to really think and feel about the different systems.<br/><br/>Instead we got a lecture on how to live thinly disguised as a story, and tepidly weak writing as a result. The lecture was a bit too anti materialism and contained a sort of naive positivity towards lifelong drug use, but it had some wonderful stuff about physical activity, adoption clubs, thoughtfulness, teaching. styles, and sexual positivity. <br/><br/>Anyway, I think a prospective reader would do better to read a bullet point summary of Huxley's key propositions on Wikipedia.",

There is obviously a complicated backstory which would make me feel very differently about everything happening, but most of the characters aren’t privy to the truth and neither am I. If it can carry on this promise for the whole book without letting me down, it’ll be very good indeed. (i wrote this 1.5h into a 22h book) Ok so now I'm finished and the verdict is in... SO GOOD. yes there is a flaw here and there, but overall i'd say this is the best thing I've read in this current 34 book spree. hard to choose between a 4 and a 5, but I do need to acknowledge that it had some flaws.",

It loses points for me on the ending, which got kinda lamely religious.<br/><br/>40h book, holy cow. man, this book really does emotionally engage me. I feel real disappointment, like how <spoiler>tia reacts to carrise's feelings about gavins death</spoiler>. i understand both character's viewpoints, and hate to see it tear them apart. lost count of the number of actual emotional scenes. teared up several times, not just for deaths but also for emotional reunions. also was super excited for some parts, like <spoiler>when gunner showed up</spoiler>. I love the ambiguity of not having a single hero, and how the characters try to reconcile this. and characters we love killing each other, <spoiler>like cruxer and iron fist</spoiler>. Final verdict. Absolutely excellent, highly recommend. A little religious at the end, but oh well.",

      "my_review": "It had potential, but it just failed to deliver on it. In a word, it was clumsy. It's been kinda hard for me to define what exactly clumsiness is, but I'll give a go at a couple examples.<br/><br/>It had good mystery, but it gave you too much mystery too fast, so it felt like it was cliche. It had that fun trope of, \"hidden magic no one knows about\" but it gave you too much, too fast, so it felt cliche. There were no realistic slow parts. For example, as soon as you saw from the shadow's point of view, she's immediately taken to the secret lair, and then she immediately gets approached by the crazy guy noone has ever approached before, then he immediately kills her brand new friend that idk why i'm supposed to like after only 5 minutes with him. and ofc she is immediately brought into the closest circle of trust of the most important people. <br/><br/>idk, the whole thing was just too constantly cliche, like it was sadly aping better fiction. It knew what it was supposed to do, and it tried its best, but it could neveractually pull it off.<br/><br/>And it REALLY failed to have any plot or emotional investment from me. and jesus, that doesn't even mention that everytime there was the potential for suprise or suspense, it's like the author went out of their way to ruin it completely. gross forshadowing that leaves no one in doubt that the unobtrusive character is really the prince. a character \"dies\" and then instead of letting us think that for a while from the viewpoint of their friends, instead the author immediately takes of to the viewpoint of the dead character so we can't possibly have any suspense. there are 3 books, but I won't bother with the next ones.",

However, I bought it alongside Logo (revised edition) by Michael Evamy, and I can't help but notice that even though the print quality is worse and it has only 1.6k logos to this book's 6k, I somehow like it more. Logo has significantly better organization and a short snippet about every logo, compared with Modernism's date, country, and industry metadata. I had originally thought that I would buy the other books in the Modernism series, but at a price of ~$60, I'll be refraining.",

An evil bastard as the main character who you nonetheless can't imagine not rooting for, and maybe he just isn't so evil after all. I really liked the ending, got super excited at some bits. ...the way the bad brother killed the good brother so casually. literally *never* saw that coming. magic is definitely there as a plot device but somehow i can't manage to begrudge it, it's done well, and so if feels natural. The whole dual plot as you slowly learn the past and the present, side-by-side, was very well done. exciting and interesting throughout. <br/><br/>Probably even more quoteable than the first book, lots of really nice turns of phrase: I wrote down a couple of them, but many wouldn't make sense out of context so I didn't bother.  *talks about the beauty of the countryside before finding a tick* öh well. even eden had a snake problem\" \"reich couldn't make an omlette without wading thigh deep in the blood of chickens and wearing their entrails as a necklace.\" There is an absolutely excellent part about decapitation, too long to quote, it can be found at: 7:20 in the Joe Jameson version, if at 1x speed.

The book was always telling you what would happen next, and not in an intrigue building or 4th wall breaking kinda way, but in a lame suspense killing, putting-on-airs kinda way. <br/><br/>After struggling through page after page of our protagonist's obsession with a dog, I finally got to the fantasy world only to discover that it was crushingly lame and boring. There were all these horribly disfigured people, but instead of catching my emotions, the author somehow couldn't make me care. <br/><br/>I actually read Stephen King's <i>On Writing</i> a while back and though it had some excellent advice, so I was honestly shocked by how much I disliked this book.",

      "my_review": "meh. it just...wasn't engaging. <br/><br/>On the surface, this was a book full of intensity and action...and yet I can't say I felt a single strong emotion while reading it. Books often make me cry, but here, when central characters died, I felt nothing. We are treated to a world brimming with rape, murder, arson, and endless horrors...that is somehow made endlessly boring. <br/><br/>The world Butler paints is disjointed and often silly. You're telling me there's a functioning government that acknowledges property rights, levies taxes, maintains a functioning police, a national guard, and a fire department, and yet on these same streets there is constant arson, idle rape, and rampant cannibalism?<br/><br/>It's like Butler wanted to make sure we had all the bad things, and thus shoved them into the story without worrying whether she could craft emotional impact or maintain believability. Government corruption? Well, we'll need a government for that. Loss of property? OH, let's invent a totally believable drug that turns people into arsonists! Resourceful heroine who can be conveniently weak sometimes for plot reasons, but not because she's literally weaker because that would be sexist? Maybe we'll manufacture a supposedly debilitating ability to empathize with people? God forbid we give her an actually interesting reason to be an impotent wielder of violence...like morals. The whole religious earthseed subplot could have deftly weaved this in, but no.<br/><br/>Instead we are treated to the dismal silliness of the 'feeler' defect. It had no meaningful impact on narrative or character development except to artificially weaken the main character whenever the plot required, and to be quietly forgotten when not convenient to the story. And lest you suspect that it allowed us to see the world through the emotional eyes of an empathetic narrator...it did not. Our \"highly empathetic narrator\" maintains an unfeeling stoicism throughout.<br/><br/>And the characters. The characters? Endlessly forgettable. The people they collected on the road didn't have their own interesting personalities, I couldn't even tell who was who. Someone would die, and I'd have to wrack my brain for an identifying characteristic. <br/><br/>And on top of all that, the audio book started by spoiling <spoiler>that her community was going to be destroyed</spoiler> (which doesn't happen until literally the halfway point, 5 hours into the book). yeah, I can't think that I would recommend this to anyone.",

      "my_review": "This book was like plunging my hands into a bag of shit-covered diamonds. There were parts that stuck me to my core, but also parts that struck me as ridiculous. Some deep insights, and some deeply unrealized potential.<br/><br/>It relies heavily on this theme I hate where characters never understand each other's feelings...not because of irreconcilable differences, but because they are too stupid to talk to each other. I suppose this happens occasionally in real life, but frankly in literature I view it as the sort of lazy writing only resorted to when genuine character interactions are incapable of creating plot and tension. It's just so dissatisfying to read a book that is otherwise very serious and deep, dealing with complicated human emotions and dynamics, and yet insists on basing every conflict and major plot development on misunderstandings that could easily be resolved with a quick chat. <br/><br/>I recently read another book where there was this deep secret threatening to tear apart a friend group. But then lo and behold, they talked it over liked regular freaking people...of course, it turns out their friend group was still destroyed, but it was for legitimate ideological differences between the characters, and not in service of the made up plot device of miscommunication.<br/><br/>But anyway, I did enjoy much of the book. It has its fair share of deep and cutting insights into the human condition that seem real without being trite. It's the kind of book I would maybe recommend to my emotionally contemplative friends (@Mononita?), but I'm not sure who else. <br/><br/>In the first half of the book, it squeezed some true emotional involvement out of me. Once, I remember just shaking my head miserably as I foresaw the train-wreck of a character's choices. I was excited to be miserable, because the bad choices were not plot driven, but rather character driven, and made sense and gripped me tightly. However, as stated before this stops being true in the final quarter of the book, and is a big part of why I struggle to go higher than 3 stars.<br/><br/>Emotionally, it does a good job with death. After a car wreck, there's a passing line about his mother, where the narrator casually says 'her body was cooling' which somehow hit me way harder than any explicit mention of death would have. And in the hospital where the estranged husband and wife are making cranes for their comatose son and the narrator says, 'this is marriage'. There were quite a few parts in there where I slightly teared up. <br/><br/>I found myself feeling a growing nostalgia for my youth, a longing for the relationships that I might have had, a remorse for the years that have passed me by. \"It's about first chances and second chances, fleeting chances and only chances, and the fear that time is running out.\"<br/><br/>However, although I definitely felt some real feelings during the book, this is not a solid recommendation from me. plot-wise, I don't buy this ridiculous gap of 5 years. it's just weirdly inhuman after all of Sam's efforts to reconnect. <br/><br/>The author was absolutely using this book as a chance to talk about her personal politics, which, if you can weave it into the story without me noticing, then I don't mind at all. For example, the author's political feelings on gay marriage were reasonably integrated and felt like a touching part of the story. However, the book was anti-gun in a preachy way that distracted me from what was otherwise an emotionally devastating act of gun violence. A talented author could have let the horrible nature of gun violence speak for itself, using emotion to make a point that thousands of pages of argumentation could never achieve. But instead it's like she was worried we just really wouldn't get the point, so she made sure to write the character's internal dialog in a fake and stilted way, inserting a blithe fear and unrealistic ignorance of firearms that no actual gamer who played first person shooters would have, thereby breaking immersion in the story. <br/><br/>On that note, the author seemed to have a general lack of understanding of the sorts of things a casual gamer would know. I found some of the video game references to be forced and fake...it was like she googled \"best games ever\" and then made sure to have a character randomly mention each title in passing so we the reader would be pleased at seeing our favorite game written on the page. Also...burning out multiple graphics cards? um what? callous on his finger from playing games? um...what? <br/><br/>Anyway. I did like this book. It made me feel things, it made me think, it almost made me cry. But then it kinda spoiled it forced references, bad plot, and politics at the expense of immersion.<br/>",

      "my_review": "<br/>It enthralled me; the premise, the setting, the characters, the initially deft handling of pervasive systematic prejudices. I absolutely loved the magic system. I stopped halfway through the book to write that it beautifully handled sexism and racism in a realistic and haunting way that never felt forced or shoehorned, just true and heartbreaking. But ultimately my enjoyment was marred by the author's damaging message that the privileged and the oppressed can never become allies. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.<br/><b>Colonialism</b><br/>The main characters are a Haitain woman, an Indian man, a Chinese man, and an English woman who are all struggling with being second class citizens and outsiders on their college campus. It's the 1830s, and there is casual and pervasive systemic sexism and racism that quietly, and at times loudly, colours their otherwise charmed lives. However over the course of many years, these four bond irrevocably and form a deep friendship. <br/><br/>Then the foriegn born characters get involved with an underground movement resistenting the force of colonialism and a hidden plot by the faculty to start a war with China. When the Englishwoman finds out, she initially can't understand, but ultimately she is able to compare her own struggles with those of her friends, and she joins their cause as a true ally. Except she doesn't. The author instead uses this beautiful moment of people coming together to fix the world as a backdrop for a suprise betrayal. The Englishwoman betrays her friends, killing one of them and imprisioning the rest, in order for the author to show the reader that the privileged will never join the oppressed to change the world for the better. <br/><br/>This message is repeated when the surviving foriegn friends stage a takeover of the college, and in a spectacular demonstration are able to prove once and for all that the college faculty has been manipulative and lying and is planning a war. Any college in the real world would have students who are itching to defy authority and be part of something bigger. However in the book when it comes time to choose sides, the author is careful to let us know that not one single traditionally privileged student or faculty joins in with the cause. <br/><br/>To be fair, the tradespeople eventually 'ally' with the babel students. But I think the author is careful not to show this as an act of allying with the cause of helping the colonized countries, but rather an act of two enemies temporarily holding hands to fight a common enemy.<br/><br/>There's also the ridiculously unnuanced portrayal of all the bad guys (colonial administrators) as exaggerated comicbook-style villians cackling maniacly as they plunder the subhuman nations of the world.<br/><br/><b>Technology</b><br/>I'm getting a little tired of writing, but I'd also like to mention the author's not-so-subtle anti-technology stance. There are clear parallels between the book's silver magic created by the universities and our own worlds upcoming LLM revolution, and I would have loved to see a nuanced examination of the issues. Instead I got an infantile, 'technoglogy bad' chorus.<br/><br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/>There was so much to like in this book. It had some absolutely awesome commentary about translating and the nature of understanding. The magic system was innovative and fascinating and perfectly complimented the plot and the central themes. But the author's weird insistence that people who benefit from opressive systems are indistinguishable from the system itself, and can never break free of it's clutches to understand and partner with the oppressed...I think this is just an incredibly damaging message to be preaching to a world that still has so much room for understanding.",

      "my_review": "Exciting and fun, but RIDDLED with problems. It's so strange to enjoy reading a book, barely noticing the hours fly by, but to look back and be mortified by the inconsistencies and bad research.<br/><br/><b>Training/Weapons</b><br/>There's a deep lack of understanding of fighting, training, and weapons that even cursory editing could have fixed.<br/><br/>- <i>muscle growth</i>: 16 yo female main character becomes too muscular to fit her old clothes after 1.5 weeks of working out<br/>- <i>injuries</i>: 16 y/o female main character is brutally beaten, punched, and kicked into unconsciousness by a 16 y/o male who is a <b>foot</b> taller than her, and after an ~hour hospital stay only suffers some minor bruises<br/>- <i>knife throwing</i>: when learning to throw knives, every character has trouble hitting the target...not having the knife stick, just having it hit the target at all<br/>- <i>guns</i>: It's hard to even know where to start with guns. There were so many: \"the bullet clicked into the chamber\" or \"<character> looked down into the gun to see how many bullets it had left\" to convince me that the author's knowledge of firearms seems to have come from an intense study of guns illustrated exclusively using Rorschach ink blobs<br/><br/><b>Plot</b><br/>- <i>mercurial emotions</i>: I certainly accept the notion that a teenager might have confused emotions that flit between hot and cold for their romantic interest. But instead of the situation or character actions showing why the Triss switches randomly from thinking Tobias was scary to sexy, instead the author just switched the MC's viewpoint whenever the plot most demanded it<br/>- <i>mind control</i>: I don't buy for a second that the Dauntless would mind control their entire population. It gives away too much power and is COMPLETELY against everything someone with a Dauntless personality would stand for. We could have just as easily had a plot where the Dauntless were greedy and cooperated with the Erudites, but were lied to and tricked into the mind control.<br/>- <i>mother's sacrifice</i>: um, what the hell was that random and useless \"sacrifice\" by the mother? and why did she start it off by uselessly shooting three bullets into the air after she had just finished killing a bunch of guards?<br/>- <i>killing Will but not Eric</i>: you're telling me Triss shoots someone she hates in the foot, and then shoots one of her best friends in the head? ok.<br/>- <i>drowning chamber</i>: you're telling me that in the middle of a military takeover where political leaders are being casually shot in the head, the people in power take a quick break to build a drowning box to execute a 16 y/o girl so she can conveniently be saved by her mother?<br/><br/>So yeah, I had fun reading it. Enough fun to give it 3 stars instead of the 2 stars it probably deserved. But for the love of god it would be nice if this author could be shown even a crayon drawing of what a gun looks like, or have someone inform her that having your plot compared to swiss cheese is <i>not</i> a compliment.",

      "my_review": "Flawed and only mildly engaging. The goodreads ratings for books 2 and 3 are even lower, so I will definitely not continue. <br/><br/>The whole premise is this conflict of birth between the two main characters that eventually gets resolved, set on the backdrop of dragons and war. In another writer's hands, the premise may have been good. But then, they would have had to have written characters whose conflicts actually made sense, instead of this ridiculously manufactured nonsense that we get instead.<br/><br/>On the one hand, he's supposed to be this borderline perfect human being that has supported her through her entire life, helping her through all her most difficult moments. Excepting a single outburst when he was a child, he is universially gentle and kind. Not to mention smart, charismatic, and always able to say the right thing at the right moment...and of course he is always, <i>always</i> thinking about her well-being.<br/><br/>And you expect me to believe that she's still hung up on who his murdered parents were? That she holds some deep resentment that her murdered parents were peasants and his murdered parents were royalty? Um no, because I don't buy it. They were raised together in the same orphanage where literally 90% of the flashbacks are about how much he cared for her. He's endlessly thinking about her. <br/><br/>The plot idea of two young kids at odds because of class and history is neat, but you can't write them as best friends and expect me to believe one secretly resents the other, <i>especially</i> not when they've had all the same life opportunities and experiences.<br/><br/>There was other stuff like this, character actions and emotions seemingly manufactured for the sake of the plot. This marks my 3rd try at a YA series in the past week, and I can't say I have any desire to continue the trend.",

      "my_review": "Time travel? I'd like to travel back in time and stop myself from reading this sorry excuse for a 5th grade writing project. It was like shoving my head into a bag of rotting milk and taking deep, gulping breaths. Somewhere near the 25% mark of this book, I was done, ready to DNF, but through some disgusting quirk of masochism I decided it might be fulfilling to read the whole thing just to write a savage review at the end...And here we are.<br/><br/>International scientific megacorp Absolom is harboring a dark secret. A secret that knits together the small band of scientist-founders and will lead our main character on a daunting journey... You see, before discovering how to transmit matter through space and time, they were originally researching how to transmit matter <i>just through space!!!!!!!!</i> It is a great secret that they must keep from their children...<i>and the world!!!!</i><br/><br/>I'm sorry, what? Why the hell is that even a secret? Scientists serendipitously discover related technologies all the time. I mean, sure, if you forced me to, I could come up with some reasons and let the author know about them, but in the actual book, they act like it's this huge deal in order to create mystery and suspense when it clearly isn't, and in the process, I, the reader, am left wondering where all this supposed mystery and suspense was. <br/><br/>And holy hell the ridiculous premise. They invented the groundbreaking ability to travel through time and transport matter to another dimension and the thing society decided to do with it was to...transport criminals??? And this super neato new punishment that only applies to the worst criminals eliminated almost all crime?? First, yeah right. Second, in America alone, we spend 10s of billions of dollars every year disposing of nuclear waste. Even a minimally creative person would understand that something more mundane but necessary/profitable such as trash disposal or nuclear disposal would be more likely. (tbf, the author does mention this in passing around the 90% mark of the book, but, like the rest of his fiction, his explanation isn't even a little convincing.)<br/><br/>The author's gross lack of any scientific or common sensibilities shows at every turn. It's a hard number to pin down, but there are estimates that as few as 5% of species that exist leave a fossil record. So if you were a world renowned expert and knew every single fossil ever discovered and then you went back 200 million years, then you might recognize maybe 1 out of 20 of the animals walking around. Not our main character though. This megagenius had a couple chats with his biology-literate financial advisor before being transported to the Triassic and he confidently gives the scientific name for <i>every single</i> species he encounters.<br/><br/>Reviews made a big deal out of the twists and turns and surprises but I swear to god the author revealed every single twist chapters ahead of time with a convenient \"hint\". <spoiler>Nora isn't dead is revealed by the organ company phone call. Adaline is going to the past revealed by diamond ear rings. etc etc</spoiler>. And don't even get me started on how stupid our main character's adventures in the Triassic were. 'Painfully cringe' is about all I have the energy to write. <br/><br/>I don't know if this is real literary advice, but after reading this book, if it isn't, it should be. \"Show, don't tell\". This author is seemingly incapable of communicating a character's thoughts, feelings, emotions, or personality through anything except bland and stilted information sessions. In a better book, you might follow along with a character's journey and witness their raw intelligence, or the way they blossom into a confident adult. In this glorious work, we are treated to such brilliant prose as:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Adeline was discovering a whole new side of herself. There was a fighter inside of her, a person she never knew existed and wouldn’t have if not for Nora’s death and her father’s exile. She marveled then that one never knew what they were made of until their back was against the wall.<br/></blockquote><br/>and<br/><blockquote><br/>The name of the dinosaur he had seen occurred to him too. It was a Coelophysis. Daniele had pronounced the C like an S, the first part of the name pronounced like “seel,” the middle like “oh.” He was amazed that his mind worked like that—he could remember the tiniest details that fascinated him (like dinosaurs), but most days he could barely remember what he did the day before.<br/><br/>He decided to call the dinosaur a “seelo.” If he ever saw one again.<br/>...<br/>That’s how his mind worked: he liked to name things and order them. That may have been what made him a successful physicist.<br/><br/>Almost against his will, Sam laughed at that. Successful. Yeah right. What a career he’d had: faking enthusiasm for a time travel machine he thought was baloney (in order to make money to save his dying wife), then accidentally helping to create that supposedly fake time travel machine, and finally being banished from his own universe with the machine he had faked enthusiasm for in the first place. There were disasters, and then there was his life.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway, I hate this book, and I hate myself for reading it. If you somehow have the good fortune to be reading this review before plunging neck deep into the putrid filth that is <i>Lost in Time</i>, do yourself a favor and find some other book, any book, and read that instead.",

      "my_review": "Deeply cutting and frequenty moving, <i>Poisonwood Bible</i> was a delight to read. Sadly, it lost it's steam in the last 3rd or so, hence 4 instead of 5, but it's absolutely one of the best books I've read this year. I love Barbara's writing and the narrator of my 1998 Brilliance edition was excellent, nailing the subtle southern old person accent. Having grown up in the bible belt, Barbra has some quotes that absolutely nail the fundamentalist mindset. I cried a couple times in this book, notably at mother may I and another that I can't remember.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Father feels makeup and nail polish are warning signals of prostitution, the same as pierced ears.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Our Father probably interpreted Broca’s aphasia as God’s Christmas bonus to one of His worthier employees.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Sending a girl to college is like pouring water in your shoes,” he still loves to say, as often as possible. “It’s hard to say which is worse, seeing it run out and waste the water, or seeing it hold in and wreck the shoes.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>That is the best way I can think of to translate the message. Actually he said you are leading our villagers down into a hole, where they may fail to see the proper sun and become trapped like bugs on a rotten carcass.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The things we do not know, independently and in unison as a family, would fill two separate baskets, each with a large hole in the bottom.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But where is the place for girls in that Kingdom? The rules don’t quite apply to us, nor protect us either. What do a girl’s bravery and righteousness count for, unless she is also pretty? Just try being the smartest and most Christian seventh-grade girl in Bethlehem, Georgia. Your classmates will smirk and call you a square. Call you worse, if you’re Adah.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>And perhaps it was not evil I saw but merely the way of all hearts when fear has stripped off the husk of kind pretensions.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This one's pretty long, but the way Barbara just kinda casually reveals the domestic situation over the course of the book is chilling.<br/><blockquote><br/>“I wonder what outlook you might think that to be,” he said to Mother in that same special voice, for bad dogs and morons.<br/><br/>She brushed her hair out of her face and smiled at him as she reached across for the china platter. “Well, for one thing, sir, you and the good Lord better hope no lightning strikes around here in the next six months!”<br/><br/> “Orleanna, shut up!” he yelled, grabbing her arm hard and jerking the plate out of her hand. He raised it up over her head and slammed it down hard on the table, cracking it right in two. The smaller half flipped upside down as it broke, and lay there dribbling black plantain juice like blood onto the tablecloth. Mother stood helplessly, holding her hands out to the plate like she wished she could mend its hurt feelings.<br/><br/>“You were getting too fond of that plate. Don’t you think I’ve noticed?”<br/><br/>She didn’t answer him.<br/><br/>“I had hoped you might know better than to waste your devotion on the things of this world, but apparently I was mistaken. I am ashamed of you.”<br/><br/>“You’re right,” she said quietly. “I was too fond of that plate.”<br/><br/>He studied her. Father is not one to let you get away with simply apologizing. He asked her with a mean little smile, “Who were you showing off for here, -with your tablecloth and your fancy plate?” He said the words in a sour way, as if they were well-known sins.<br/><br/>Mother merely stood there before him while all the sparkle drained out of her face.<br/><br/>“And your pitiful cooking, Orleanna? The way to a young Negro’s heart is through his stomach—is that what you were counting on?”<br/><br/>Her light blue eyes had gone blank, like shallow pans of water. You could honestly not tell what she was thinking. I always watch his hands to see which way they’re going to strike out. But Mother’s shallow-water eyes stayed on his face, without really looking at it.<br/></blockquote><br/>",

      "my_review": "What a strange book. I'm kinda...neutral about it? I wonder how it reads in the original french? In english, it's a bit stilted and rambling..which I suppose makes sense. It <i>is</i> very original, and I like what the author does with the plot, but it kinda strikes me as an undergraduate's first artistic writing project. At ~200 pages, it was already quite short, but I rather felt it could have been shorter. I figure some people might find it deeply insightful or symbolic or something. There were certainly a couple nice quotes, but I can't say that it gave me any particular intellectual excitement.  <br/><br/>I'm tempted to say that its weird lack of a message was a virtue, but what then is the point of writing? Anyone can scribble to no end.<br/><br/>I don't regret the couple hours of reading, but I definitely won't be recommending this to anyone.",

And ya know? The relinquishing of responsibly is almost worth it. Then his useless family get real jobs, they weirdly abstain from any attempts at communication, and when he finally starves himself to no longer be a burden, they discard his dead body like garbage.<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>I mean yeah. I can see why this has long served as an endless springboard for the contrived symbolism of dreary lit classes, and I'm sure the style was unique and shocking when originally published. But on the heels of reading Lolita, Pride and Prejudice, and the Handmaid's Tale, I can hardly see that this deserves its acclaim.",

      "my_review": "I was not prepared. Nabokov plays with the reader. Under his deft pen, the english language is warped to make the normal disgusting, and the disgusting rational. He is a twisted sculptor of words, erecting endless masterpieces to astonish and horrify. <br/><br/>His novel wraps its claws delicately around your mind, pulling you deeper into dark waters until at once you emerge gasping, wondering what the fuck you just read. At one point our pedophile main character was describing his disdain for his conventionally sexy adult wife, and I found myself thinking, “ew gross, boobs, yeah i hate those...wait what!?”<br/><br/>It simply cannot be overstated how masterfully Nabokov's words illustrate his rancid portraits, and I must say that Jeremy Irons' narration did the novel no small justice. <br/><br/>Sadly, I felt the novel rather lagged during its middle sections, and could probably have lost ~100 pages with little ill effect. I'd say it probably deserves 4.5 stars instead of 5.",

This novel lacks a strong plot, is a little handwavey about the magical details, and is a bit cheesy...but I still quite enjoyed the read. The author writes a delightful circus in a fractured timeline with fun concepts and a satisfying conclusion, all readable in a long afternoon. <br/><br/>There seems to be an abundance of comments complaining that this book did not live up to to their expectation of an epic, magic, circus duel, and I can only reflect that so long as one has not polluted their mind with the misleading goodreads summary, the book itself is very straightforward about its tone and trajectory.",

      "my_review": "Should be required reading. Ingersoll's passionate 1890 address on prison reform puts modern audiences to shame. It's a travesty that his 133 year old words still sound naively optimistic to our supposedly more advanced and progressive ears.<br/><br/>I've assembled the following quotes in order to capture the flavor and arguments of his 59 page speech. By necessity, much has been left out, and if the words reproduced here are at all of interest, I recommend looking for one of the many free pdf scans available online. 30 minutes could see the whole thing read, cover to cover.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>All nations seem to have had supreme confidence in the deterrent power of threatened and inflicted pain. They have regarded punishment as the shortest road to reformation...nations have relied on confiscation and degradation, on maimings, whippings, brandings, and exposure to public ridicule and contempt...Curiously enough, the fact is that, no matter how severe the punishments were, the crimes increased.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Degradation has been thoroughly tried...and the result was that those who inflicted the punishments became as degraded as their victims.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Is it not true that the criminal is a natural product, and that society unconsciously produces these children of vice? Can we not safely take another step, and say that the criminal is a victim, as the diseased and deformed and insane are victims? We do not think of punishing a man because he is afflicted with disease--our desire is to find a cure. We send him, not to the penitentiary, but to the hospital, to an asylum...instead of punishing, we pity. If there are diseases of the mind...as there are diseases of the body...and if these deformities produce what we call vice, why should we punish the criminal, and pity those who are physically diseased?<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Those who are not affected by the agonies of the bad, will in a little time care nothing for the sufferings of the good.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>The average man does not wish to employ an ex-convict, because the average man has no confidence in the reforming powers of the penitentiary. He believes that the convict who comes out is worse than the convict who went in. <br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>What avenue is open to the ex-convict? If he changes his name, there will be some detective, some officer of the law, some meddlesome wretch, who will betray his secret. He is then discharged...He must seek employment again by telling that which is not true. He is again detected and again discharged. And finally he becomes convinced that he cannot live as an honest man.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>It has been contended that the death penalty deters others...A few years ago a man was hanged in Virginia. One who witnessed the execution, on that very day murdered a peddler...He was tried and executed, and one who witness his hanging went home, and on the same day murdered his wife.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Those who are the fiercest to destroy their fellow men for having committed crimes, are, for the most part, at heart, criminals themselves.<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>Some may be, and probably millions have been, reformed, through kindness, through gratitude--made better in the sunlight of charity. In the atmosphere of kindness the seeds of virtue burst into bud and flower. Cruelty, tyranny, brute force, do not and cannot by any possibility better the heart of man. <br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/>All the penalties, all the punishments, are inflicted under a belief that man can do right under all circumstances--that his conduct is absolutely under his control, and that his will is a pilot that can, in spite of winds and tides, reach any port desired. All this is, in my judgement, a mistake...as long as this mistake remains the cornerstone of criminal jurisprudence, reformation will be impossible.<br/></blockquote>",

      "my_review": "Ugh. It is simply enraging, the frequency with which the author engenders miscommunication between characters by confidently proclaiming, \"but the character couldn't possibly describe it, because the words simply didn't exist,\" moments before <bold>immediately describing it in simple English to the reader</bold>. Don't expect me to believe that an intelligent, well-educated character can't possibly explain what you casually achieve a sentence later.<br/><br/>Admittedly a minor nitpick here, but I swear this author has a deep misunderstanding of how big cities are. She describes the entire world as being composed of microscopic 200 person townships, barely subsisting, and yet the equatorial cities hold millions and millions of people? Where are the medium sized cities? Where do the millions get their food? I mean, I don't wanna be that guy obsessing about the sustainability of the agricultural infrastructure in a fantasy novel...but come on. <br/><br/>Another nitpick here, but I'll be in the middle of the story, consumed by the worldbuilding, when suddenly the author will distractingly insert her modern, 2017 views on gender, sex, or race. I do enjoy seeing these topics in my books, as they make you think, remind you how society should be, and can help change the cultural zeitgeist for the better. But I shouldn't suddenly feel preached to in the middle of a novel about <bold>magic earthquake wizards</bold>. Plenty of authors manage to include commentary on sexism, sexuality, racism, etc while making it a graceful and fluid part of the story. Just glancing at the books I read in July, see: Earthsea, Handmaid's Tale, Poisonwood Bible, and Circe for some excellent examples.<br/><br/>But anyway, nitpicks aside, I constantly wanted to give this series a chance; as it had so much obvious potential, but I really can't recommend it. Yes, the concept is great, but the execution is deeply flawed. The magic and power levels change constantly just to fit the plot, the character writing and behaviors change at the whim of the author, and the author is constantly pulling your attention out of the story with nitpicky bs.",

Still not sure if I want a happy or a tragic end for her and the mother, although the daughter is clearly about to become the powerful villain. The daughter seems the most realistic of all the characters, with her troubled pre-teen longings and adolescent logic.

      "my_review": "Engaging, fast-paced, imaginative. Really a quite good book. However...I think the power-system is a little underdeveloped. The distance between what a character can accomplish when the plot demands they be powerful, and what a character can accomplish with the plot demands they be weak is too great. <br/><br/>For example, <spoiler>I can think of a dozen ways to destroy those 3 or 4 ships by either the 10 ringer or the 6 ringer. Tsunami, whirlpools, double tsunami, volcano, throwing rocks (which should have been far more successful). Instead, Alabaster's decisions were blatantly silly. Building a massive, energy consuming wall when he could have just precisely thrown boulders? I mean, honestly, that whole fight was breathtakingly stupid and unrealistic. </spoiler> <br/><br/>Stuff like this really takes away from the entire book for me. You have all this build up to a final fight, you're all invested, and then the author ruins it by having strong characters be suddenly weak for no reason, making obviously bad decisions and struggling at simple things, just so they can lose the fight for plot reasons. Compare this to Wheel of Time, where the big fights are fucking incredible and actually make sense. <br/><br/>Also, I'm deeply disappointed in the utter uselessness of the female main character during the late second and entire third part of her life. She's written as having phenomenal innate power and a vast capacity to learn and we're supposed to believe she refuses to do anything about it? This would be one thing as a character-supported decision, but this path is at odds with her personality. It reeks of an intentional weakening to support the plot instead of an honest projection of how the written character would have genuinely behaved. <br/><br/>Anyway. I'll finish the series for sure, because it features a really cool world and really cool powers. But I don't think this will make it to my list of favorites, just because of the horrible power balancing and bad character writing.",

Always making the shitty, short-sighted choices that prevent progress. But the negativity of the plot desperately stretches believability. Every possible thing that could go wrong, does go wrong, and I was just left rolling my eyes by the end.<br/><br/>I guess tldr: the books got worse as they went along.

      "my_review": "These books are short, and they occasionally feel like they lack imagination or clear thinking, but I enjoy them anyway and definitely don't regret the quick fun reads. It's like scifi trash reading, lol. <br/><br/>As for my criticisms, the reliance on smashing drones was ridiculous. It would have been child's play to make some kind of projectile system when you have atom by atom 3d printers....of course, that would have ruined large bits of plot. <br/><br/>And the libraries. Bob was originally launched with only the faith libraries, and I originally thought that not getting libraries from the rest of humanity was an gross oversight, but then, wildly, in book 2 the author directly brought it up, how they only had faith records, *completely ignoring* the whole ass 15million human population they could have gotten digital libraries from... but yeah, anyway, there are a ton of things in the books i found dumb, but i still liked them enough to keep reading.<br/><br/>Sometimes the plot feels more like a checklist of cool scifi things we need to accomplish than a well-considered and engaging plot, although I still usually stay pretty engaged in all the sub stories. I imagine i'll read 1 or 2 more books and then get bored of this series. <br/><br/>",

I can't say that it really explores too many deep themes about intelligent life or strange societies other than to notice them. Feels more like a story about interesting things than an exploration of scifi themes? The premise is pretty cool tho. <spoiler>Space explorers make first contact with the cattle of the world.</spoiler> I guess it deals a lot with unfairness and misunderstanding and the uncaring cruelty of the world, of God.<br/><spoiler><br/>A group of Jesuits visits the first known alien species. They had the best intentions, but somehow everything went horribly wrong. The book follows two timelines as we slowly learn what happened.<br/><br/>Present Day: only one of the crew has returned alive, and is horribly disfigured. We try to understand this horribly physically and mentally broken man.<br/><br/>Past: We seem him bright and alive, surrounded by his amazing colleagues, (who we unfortunately know died horrible deaths that we don’t know the details of yet)<br/></spoiler>",

I loved learning about how Newton shoved a knitting needle into his eye to establish the physical nature of sight, and how 18th century geologists were like a pack of bickering school children. It's been 11 or so years now, but I remember that I was very influenced by his and Simon Singh's writing styles when I created my own works.",

It has excellent photos of the exact bones discovered for each species, alongside key information such as placement on the body, function, notes from researchers, tools discovered at digsites and much more. It's also got migration maps, notes on lifestyle speculation, and possible facial reconstructions. This is an excellent choice for someone wanting a modernized DK style picture and words book.",
