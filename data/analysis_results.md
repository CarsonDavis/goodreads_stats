## Recommendations for API Integration

### Primary Strategy
1. **Use ISBN13 as primary identifier** (76.4% coverage)
   - Clean format: Remove `="..."` wrapper
   - 13-digit numeric string
   - Most reliable for external API lookups

### Fallback Strategy
2. **Use Title + Author combination** for remaining 180 books (23.6%)
   - Both fields are 100% populated
   - May require fuzzy matching for API calls
   - Consider normalizing punctuation and spacing

### Additional Identifiers
3. **Goodreads Book ID** as last resort
   - 100% unique and present
   - Specific to Goodreads platform
   - May not be useful for other book APIs

## Data Quality Notes

- All 24 fields are technically 100% populated (no null values)
- However, many fields contain empty strings when data is not available
- ISBN fields use Excel formatting that needs to be cleaned before API calls
- Reviews and notes contain HTML formatting that may need parsing
- Date fields use consistent YYYY/MM/DD format
- Some duplicate ISBNs exist (likely different editions of same book)
