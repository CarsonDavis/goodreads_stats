  How Goodreads Records Re-reads:

  Key findings:

  1. Single row per book: Each book gets only ONE row in the CSV, regardless of how many times it's read
  2. Read Count column: Column 23 shows the total number of times the book was read (e.g., 2, 3)
  3. Date Read shows LATEST read: The "Date Read" field contains only the most recent reading date, not all dates
  4. Examples from your data:
    - "The Selfish Gene" - Read 2 times, latest: 2012/04/01
    - "The Demon-Haunted World" - Read 3 times, latest: 2012/03/18
    - "Misquoting Jesus" - Read 2 times, latest: 2011/11/24
    - "The Shadow Rising" - Read 2 times, latest: 2018/01/27

  Important implications:
  - You lose the dates of earlier re-reads
  - Only the most recent reading date is preserved
  - The Read Count field indicates total re-reads
  - Review data is only for the most recent read (or cumulative across all reads)
